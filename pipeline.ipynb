      "<scenarios><scenario><title><h1>Butler industry</h1></title><subtitle><h2>A day in 2050</h2></subtitle><text>A modern cottage in the Allg&#228;u region with a wooden terrace, a friendly garden, and a spacious garage for their self-driving car - this morning Christine wakes up with a big smile on her face. This is what she and her spouse have always dreamed of and as of today, it will become reality. She gets dressed full of excitement, puts on her augmented reality glasses, and grabs a quick smoothie, before she leaves for the high-speed capsule train from Munich to Allg&#228;u. When the government started to build this new network of high-speed capsule trains, Christine and her husband immediately bought a lovely property in the countryside. Like all of her friends, Christine follows the Build it Yourself (BIY) trend and wants to have a unique home with individual style. Through 3D printing technologies, customized houses are on the rise. For example, a befriended couple just built a gorgeous house in a Swedish style.\n",
      "To fulfill her dream of a modern cottage, Christine designed a 3D model in the BIY app together with her husband. Right after they uploaded it to the BIY platform, they found their perfect match - Peter, a freelancing project manager, and designer with experience in modern art houses. Until today, Christine and Peter have continuously cooperated remotely on the BIY collaboration platform to virtually design and construct the house of her dreams.\n",
      "When Christine arrives in Allg&#228;u, she can&#8217;t wait to meet Peter in person. Stepping out of the capsule she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath to soak in the fresh air of the countryside. It&#8217;s still hard for her to believe that this is not just a vacation, but will soon become her everyday life. She understands, why all doctors recommend people nowadays to move away from the polluted cities into small villages. On the other side of the capsule track, she sees a man waving at her. Soon, her augmented reality glasses recognize: It&#8217;s Peter.\n",
      "Waiting for Christine to come to the other side of the track, Peter&#8217;s thoughts drift away. He is a professional designer and construction project manager for more than ten years now. Most of his project experience consists of planning and supervising private modern style houses. His main duties concern fulfilling the client&#8217;s wishes and ensuring technical feasibility. As local building laws have been simplified, EU citizens&#8217; diversity can be reflected more easily within their designs. He is also responsible for maintaining the initial cost and time frame. It is very important for him to be at the customers&#8217; side from the beginning until the end of the construction project. It fascinates him and he feels very proud whenever he can respond to the wishes of his customers and see them being happy after moving into one of his finished buildings.\n",
      "He and Christine got in touch via the BIY platform as many of his other clients did in the past. Using her drawings and her basic model he was able to develop a detailed digital twin of the future cottage. Through augmented reality, he was able to show Christine a fully modeled 3D version of the building, the garden, and even the surrounding areas. Not only the outside view, but all rooms inside the building, as well as the preferred furniture, have been visualized. Today is the final meeting for making changes before the construction phase starts. Further change requests can still be applied during the construction phase because the overall process is designed to be highly flexible until the very last second. However, through virtual reality, customers have a sound image of the future building, which reduces critical change requests to a minimum. \n",
      "On their way to the property, Christine and Peter discuss some final details. Peter can rely on his many years of experience and an artificial intelligence helps him with design aspects. The artificial intelligence returns warning messages, if certain ideas have not met long-term customer satisfaction in the past. Every time a final form is ready, Peter feeds the model into his online building platform. The platform&#8217;s smart algorithm is calculating labor, raw materials, and machinery required to build this project. Additionally, a structural analysis is computed. \n",
      "In the middle of the discussion, the autonomous car is starting to slow down. Peter and Christine take a glimpse outside the window. They spot the property surrounded by some trucks and machines. Finally, the car smoothly stops in front of it. Leaving the car, Peter introduces Bob, the construction worker responsible for supervising the construction site, to Christine. Peter found Bob via an online marketplace. Online marketplaces are essential to get an overview of the current situation, and the availability of labor, raw materials, logistics and machinery. Peter loves to find the best possible combination of workforce and hardware to get the best cost value ratio. After Peter has calculated the cost frame , he allocates the resources. This allows him to hire co-workers through a global freelancing platform and select them based on experience, rating and availability. Peter decided to hire Bob for this project, because he is an old school construction site worker. For more than 30 years Bob completed hundreds of construction projects. He grew up in Munich and was used to the hard-manual work related to his job, but adapted to the new digital era on construction sites.\n",
      "After getting to know each other, Peter, Bob and Christine put on their VR glasses and walk around the displayed house. As they pass the northern side of the building, a warning from the building AI is displayed stating that too little sunlight is getting through into the bathroom. Peter recommends using taller windows with a special glass material allowing to be transparent only  from the inside. Christine agrees to the change proposal and they add it to the model.\n",
      "Christine recognizes that she is not yet sure about the placement of the door in the living room. Insecurely she approaches Peter who, after talking to Bob, reassures that change requests can be incorporated during the whole construction process as long as the respective parts are not built yet. Nevertheless, they decide to move the door and Peter quickly implements these changes into the model which is then synced with the project management app. Afterwards, Bob syncs the model with his devices and machines. The project management software already scheduled which machine has to work in which time slots. As advised by the project management software, Bob starts to sync the model with his digger, which starts by autonomously digging the hole for the basement. Simultaneously he starts up his construction machine, which is a modern version of a 3D printer. It is capable of moving itself and layering concrete in a very accurate and fast way. Bob has to configure the machine for the materials which are going to be used - adapted to the wishes of Christine.\n",
      "Relieved and proud of her design, Christine finally watches the digger beginning with its work. She feels glad that she came here to see everything in person - even though this is unusual for customers nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the digger has finished, the construction machine moves to its starting point and Bob instructs the crane on the truck to supply the construction machine with the materials. He remembers the old times when he had to use heavy machines himself. Nowadays he can use small devices with intuitive interfaces to operate all the big machines. His younger colleagues are very different, rather skinny and not knowing how work has been 30 years ago. He is happy that times changed because now he can treat his body with care while working more efficiently than ever before.\n",
      "While the 3D printer is starting with the first layers, he checks the schedule of the project and he realizes that all missing resources, such as the painting robot, the prefabricated roof, and the furniture, will arrive on time. After the first layers of the house are completed, Bob employs his drone and captures first real-time data to compare it with the digital twin in the project management app. For now, his construction machine seem to work flawlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, Christine meets her husband for dinner and is happy to share her experiences with him. They agree that they are very satisfied with the freelancing atmosphere within the construction industry nowadays. It is a great feeling to have their individual ideas being valued and carefully considered by Peter. As a freelancer, he can completely devote himself to their dream house and they know, that their house is in good hands.\n",

Instead, she was giving Anna a look of high expectancy. &#8220;We want to have this treadmill which is built into the balcony. We requested that feature at Morrisons but this would have taken them ages. Are your partners able to build that until we move in?&#8221; Anna forms a smile. The last years have been a head-to-head race for market leadership in the construction industry between Morrisons and Forstner &amp;amp; S&#246;hne, Anna&#8217;s employer. Until now, it has been a tough conversation with these new clients. Now, it is up to her to close the deal and the prospect of yet another win against Morrisons fills Anna with contentment. Mr. Kumar was impressed as soon as he entered Anna&#8217;s glazed office and studied her business card thoroughly for the hundredth time. Customer Success Manager. That sounds impressive. Soon after he had moved from India to Germany with his family to work as a software specialist, he contacted her and talked in detail about the house he wanted to be built in the outskirts of Munich. Anna looks down at her notes. The house as it is planned now differs considerably from the one he originally described on the phone. Mrs. Kumar had obviously an assertive personality. Anna decides not to leave a comment on that and, instead, leans forward. &#8220;We have great connections to the RunRZ Lab which has the best meta treadmill on the market currently. It even corrects your running style. Plus, it scans your body and suggests post workout meals according to your performance and goals.&#8221;, Anna explains. She taps on her massive glass table and Mr. Kumars&#8217; eyes start to shine. He hadn&#8217;t realized yet that there was an integrated tablet computer which now displays a highly-detailed outline of his future house. Anna continues: &#8220;They can deliver in about three weeks so that there is no delay for you to move in. Let me show you how it will look like&#8221;. She hands over VR glasses to the couple and a few seconds later, Mr. and Mrs. Kumar are exploring their future home. Anna already knows that they are about to close the sale. &#8220;Thanks to the data we have generated about how happy our different customers are and about how they use the house, our algorithms have already optimized your floor plans to perfectly suit your needs. And this will hold true not only for 4 weeks. Over 97% of customers are still as happy as on day one after the first 5 years&#8221;, she explains with a highly professional voice and smiles even brighter. The superior new way of software supported construction has always been the competitive edge allowing Foster &amp;amp; S&#246;hne to build up and sustain their strong market dominance. Some minutes later, after they discussed the instantly calculated construction costs, Anna&#8217;s clients sign the contract electronically. Even before they are able to finish their glass of champagne, the tablet table beeps, indicating that the project status has been updated. Anna is happy. The local building authority has validated the purchase and the transfer of land and money has been booked on the administrative blockchain register. They will start with construction immediately. \n",
      "Soon after Mrs. and Mr. Kumar left, Anna grabs her handbag and heads to a construction site 40 km north of Munich. She walks towards the suspension railway station which has just opened recently, the biggest infrastructure project for years in Munich and a huge triumph for the Greens in parliament. The fact that it was managed by Forstner &amp;amp; S&#246;hne made Anna receive a lot of appreciative comments from family, friends, and former fellow students that were all employed by different firms in the construction industry. It was one of the first companies that recognized the need for individual solutions. As a result, highly specialized engineers were hired, and contracts with software firms were signed to enable the smart fusion of humans and machines on-site. Of course, competitors are strong these days and Anna usually considers herself lucky being in such an exciting high-tech business with a decent salary and various facilitations. She can schedule her week flexibly and almost always makes it to her yoga class at seven. However, she sometimes doubts if all the years of studying both computer science and design were worth the effort, given that her job now consists of basically fulfilling the oddest wishes of clients, which is not even put into practice by her but by technology. Anna dismisses these thoughts as she steps into the waggon and feels her phone vibrating in her bag. It has just recognized the light barrier and automatically paid for the ticket. Anna sits down and takes a deep breath. &#8220;It is crowded today&#8221;, she thinks. &#8220;Everybody seems to be constantly on the move&#8221;. There are lots of voices, lots of nationalities around her, but Anna does not hear it. \n",
      "The first thing Anna notices when she arrives at the construction site is the progress that has been made during the previous days. The wooden external cladding is already installed and some 3D printers are coating the roof with a thin layer of solar panels. Anna likes the idea of the clients to integrate trees into their home instead of removing them from the building ground. That is the best part of her job, observing how these unique homes grow step by step. Anna turns away from the building and notices that only a few people are busy steering the robots installed on-site. She heads towards the office container and finds her on-site colleagues in a little gathering. &#8220;Anna, I am glad you swing by. Can I offer you some cake?&#8221; Frank, an adjustment officer, whose job is to adapt all machines and robots to the different conditions on-site, walks across the room to welcome her. At this moment, Anna notes the &#8220;Happy 72nd Birthday&#8221; garland and the chocolate cake. She prevents herself from breaking out into laughter. Six on-site workers still wearing their exoskeletons are struggling to eat their cake with forks. They nod to Anna. &#8220;Frank, good to see you. Happy Birthday&#8221;, she says. &#8220;Thank you, but I am actually in a hurry. Just wanted to have a quick chat with Juan. Is he available?&#8221; Frank points to a door on the other side of the room. &#8220;He&#8217;s in there&#8221; Anna could hear the slight disappointment in his voice.\n",
      "&#8220;It&#8217;s like an orchestra.&#8221; Juan casually folds his hands behind his head and puts his feet on the corner of his desk. &#8220;It&#8217;s like an orchestra and I am the conductor.&#8221; Anna was grinning. During her long-term cooperation, she always liked Juan&#8217;s light-hearted personality and self-mocking character. &#8220;Is it that bad?&#8221; she asks rhetorically and sits down on one the chairs in front of Juan&#8217;s desk. He smiles at her. &#8220;Well, there are a lot of highly complicated tasks here and they all require their slot in the schedule&#8221;. Juan&#8217;s head points towards the screen next to his desk. Anna recognizes all the icons for machines and engineers subcontracted to specialist companies for the current building project. She has always been fascinated by this communication system documenting all status updates, deadlines and critical tasks. It was even connected to the robots on-site, enabling a live-simulation of the ongoing construction project. It was Juan&#8217;s role as project manager to supervise the workflows and improve quality management on-site. Juan knows the technology and is an absolute expert in his field, Anna thought, the market for these positions is so scarce. For sure, he must have been headhunted for a lot of money. She added: &#8220;And our subcontractors&#8217; invoices are skyrocketing&#8221;. Juan scratches his beard. &#8220;Yeah, I mean, the government can sign as many trade agreements as they want, it is still expensive to get the special sandstone from India, it is simply not a mass market as concrete. You wanna coffee?&#8221; When Anna shakes her head, Juan takes a sip from his coffee and puts it back on the table, indicating that small talk was over. For the rest of the afternoon, they talk through the special tasks that are necessary to fulfill the requests of the Kumar couple.\n",
      "Heaven has turned dark as Anna leaves the construction site. Wind is freshening up and leaves are flying around. The robots are still covering the roof, unimpressed by the arising thunderstorm. Anna jumps into her ordered air taxi. She is almost home when her tablet suddenly vibrates. It is the planning system, informing her that due to the heavy weather conditions, all robots need to stop operating tonight. The estimated project termination is one day later. Anna sighs. &#8220;We let robots build our homes, but nature has still the power to hold us back.&#8221;\n",

She eagerly opens her eyes and gets ready for her first day at the new job. After all the stressful applications and interviews, she had finally landed her dream job at Build.io, one of the Big Three construction firms.\n",
      "\"I called you a taxi. It will arrive in 3 minutes\" says her virtual assistant. Pranjal grabs her usual freshly baked croissant and coffee from the automated cook and heads outside. Looking around, she is greeted by the already familiar sight of the new neighborhood. It has taken a while to get used to the repetitive pattern of identical buildings when she first moved in two months earlier, but now she has settled in and actually likes it.\n",
      "The taxi arrives and Pranjal gets in, smiling politely at another person inside. Looking out the window, she reminisces about her childhood memories, when cars were not self-driving and usually weren&#8217;t shared. She thinks to herself, how inefficient and dangerous that must that have been.\n",
      "\"I don't mean to be rude, but do you happen to live in one of the B+ houses?\" asks the man, interrupting her train of thought.\"Yes, actually, I just moved into one recently&#8221; she replies.The man tells her &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of upgrading from a B and even after reading tons of reviews, I would still like to have an unbiased opinion of someone who&#8217;s lived in one.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be the best person to ask; today I&#8217;m joining Build.io&#8221; says Pranjal grinningly.&#8220;Oh, I hear it&#8217;s a great place to work. Congratulations! I&#8217;ll risk assuming you haven&#8217;t put on your fangirl hat yet. Would you recommend the switch to B+?&#8221; asks the man with a short laugh.&#8220;For me it was definitely worth it, but if I were in your place, I&#8217;d just try it. They&#8217;ve recently started offering a trial program,&#8221; Pranjal says.&#8220;Trial program?&#8221; he asks.She finishes: &#8220;Yeah. You can test the upgrade for a free month. Just send the request and they will move all your things to the new address in just half a day. Alright, this is where I&#8217;m getting off. It was nice talking to you.&#8221; &#8220;Likewise! Bye and thanks for the tip! I&#8217;ll check it out for sure,&#8221; the man responds.\n",
      "Excitedly, Pranjal steps out of the taxi and looks up to where she will be starting her first job. Directly in front of her is an impressive skyscraper with the famous Build.io logo on top, casting a long shadow on the surrounding buildings. Young people holding coffee move quickly in and out, chatting about the performance of their departments, data sets to be analyzed and corporate gossip. Pranjal inhales deeply, mumbles some motivating words to herself and enters the lobby. After being welcomed by the digital office assistant and moving up to the 43rd floor, she gets introduced to Lisa, her new supervisor. \n",
      "&#8220;Welcome to Build.io, Pranjal. We are glad to have you on board!&#8221; Lisa opens.Pranjal thanks and says &#8220;I am really looking forward to start working here!&#8221; &#8220;Good to hear that! Let me give you a quick introduction tour.&#8221; Lisa replies.While walking through the different departments, Pranjal notices several dashboards, open working areas and people in virtual conference rooms. Lisa continues while walking:\n",
      "&#8220;In your role as Junior Manager, you will be responsible for monitoring both our existing as well as newly built quarters and analyze the data we generate to enhance overall customer satisfaction. Your payment is proportional to your performance, i.e, based on the subscription churn rate of your community - but you already know that, right? At Build.io, we are not just renting out space, we are selling a lifestyle: Flexibility, a community worth living in and affordable luxury for everyone. After the third migration wave, we were forced to come up with affordable living solutions which can be built quickly.&#8221;Pranjal responds quickly: &#8220;Oh! Yes, I remember very well. My family arrived in Germany around that time.&#8221;Lisa follows up: &#8220;So, I&#8217;m guessing you probably already lived in one of our buildings - what a great story! Anyway: since we realized that construction is only one vertical of a huge market to be targeted, we decided to reposition ourselves as a LaaS provider, covering all market segments. And now, look at us! The living as a service market is a tough game, but we are proud to be the only company left to have evolved from an actual construction company. By the way, did you have lunch yet? Unfortunately, I have a meeting, but you could join Tom - he is one of the guys in charge of setting up the new communities. Good luck, Pranjal!&#8221;\n",
      "Over lunch at a delicious Falafel place, Pranjal&#8217;s new colleague, Tom, walks her through the way standardized houses are built and why they are efficient: &#8221;I coordinate a construction project, which uses autonomous trucks, humanoids, 3D printers, and drones as resources. These help us to continuously work on projects, 24 hours a day. And since energy suppliers offer a cost flatrate, the onsite workforce is cheaper than humans.&#8221;&#8220;How many humans are still working directly on construction site?&#8221; ponders Pranjal.Tom responds: &#8220;Well, finally, last year the last human worker on site retired. Currently, it&#8217;s done completely humanless and remote controlled. Therefore, all the earlier human workforce is shifted to office work and robotics lab to a greater extent.&#8221;Astonished, Pranjal concludes: &#8221;So, the houses must be cheaper than I thought.&#8221;Tom gets excited: &#8220;Well, even though the material costs are still extremely high after the steep rise in 2035, the buildings are cheaper than earlier &#160;since houses can be built faster. Still, most of the cost is material-related. Unfortunately, I have to go back to work, but let&#8217;s chat tonight at the &#8216;Meet the New Employees Night&#8217;?&#8221;&#8220;Looking forward to it! I&#8217;ll be done with setting up by 5 o&#8217;clock anyway&#8221;, replies Pranjal.That evening, at the party, she is introduced to Jeffrey, one of the senior executives at Build.io. He asks her: &#8220;Where are you from, Pranjal? Are you from Munich?&#8221;&#8220;No, I&#8217;m actually from India, but my family moved to Germany when I was a child, right after the Treaty of Dhaka, phasing out the need for a visa. I&#8217;ve been in Munich since April&#8220; she responds.&#8220;Then, I guess you&#8217;re in one of the new neighborhoods?&#8221; he replies.Pranjal smiles: &#8220;If you call the entire standardized belt around the city &#8216;new&#8217;, then yes. I live in Mammendorf, in one of the inner rings. What about you?&#8221;After some seconds, Tom responds: &#8220;Have you seen the Ludwig Beck building in the old town? I live right across it.&#8221;Pranjal: &#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re one of the old schoolers. I can&#8217;t picture myself living in that part of the city. Doesn&#8217;t it bother you that it takes forever to get a cab there? Don&#8217;t you miss all the services? I couldn&#8217;t afford to live there anyway...&#8221; &#8220;Well, of course it can be annoying sometimes, but you know, I grew up there and I own the place now. Also, I have a lot of memories associated with the old houses.&#8221; \n",
      "After having a long conversation, they leave the lounge and head back home. \n",
      "As she arrives back at her neighborhood and passes the surrounding buildings she recaps everything she experienced during her first day. &#8216;&#8216;It&#8217;s so nice,&#8217;&#8217; she thinks to herself, &#8216;&#8216;being part of the company who built all of this.&#8221;</text><sign_posts/></scenario><scenario><title><h1>Clone Wars</h1></title><subtitle><h2>A day in 2050</h2></subtitle><text>The alarm starts to ring smoothly. Franz Betzinger tries to carefully open his eyes but squints immediately as the bright sun rays seeping through the venetian blinds dazzle him for a moment. &#8220;Good morning Franz! It&#8217;s 6:45 am and the weather is wonderful on this Wednesday, it&#8217;s time to get up&#8221; the pleasant voice of his virtual home assistant remarks. Franz, with his eyes still barely open, follows the advice after some yawning and he moves the few steps from the bed to the bathroom. &#8220;Hey Alexa, how is Jane and the children?&#8221; he mumbles. \n",
      "&#8220;They&#8217;re fine. They have just reached your parent-in-law&#8217;s house in London.&#8221; Franz blurrily remembers that his wife and kids kissed him goodbye about two hours ago. He shuffles to the kitchen and once more notices how big it is compared to his previous flat. &#8220;Incredibly expensive&#8221; he reflects, thinking about the excessive price of this minimalistic 100 square meter flat which he moved to six months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "After finishing his cereal, he commands Alexa to switch off his favorite news podcast. Like on all working days, the driverless taxi waits for Franz to pick him up from the front of his apartment building in south-east Frankfurt. He never looks at his smartphone during this five-minute ride but rather enjoys to dreamily gaze at the apartment buildings and houses in this area. They are all cubical-shaped and most of them have a green garden surface on the roof. Aside from their color, size, and some other individual elements, they all look the same; especially to Franz, the director of a small construction company called Betzinger. Franz likes the homogeneity of his neighborhood but he is still fascinated by the more individualistic style of the very few buildings which were constructed before the German government introduced strict standards for material, size, and shape due to proven environmental and economic efficiency benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly before arriving at the Hyperloop station Frankfurt-East, he sees the father of Francis&#8217; best friend Mesut jogging. Franz feels sorry for him as he just lost his job as an architect. Architects are barely needed anymore and an occupational retraining to a structural engineer is quite expensive and time consuming. &#8220;We have arrived. The next pod to Munich leaves in five minutes&#8221;, the voice of the taxi interrupts Franz&#8217; thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual, on his 20-minute ride to Munich, Franz reads the daily news on the screens in the Hyperloop pod under the murmur of mostly English-held conversations by the other commuters. &#8220;Frankfurt breaks the mark of six million residents and is now ranked as the 5th largest German city,&#8221; the headline, which caught Franz&#8217; interest the most, reveals. He arrives in Munich at 7:50 am, right on time for his meeting with Stefanie, the company&#8217;s sales manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Betzinger offers end-to-end solutions for apartments and houses, using different contractors to complete each step of the process. They only construct new buildings and don&#8217;t undertake very complex and time-consuming renovation projects, which some of the other construction companies do. Such a project could last up to three months, whereas the construction of new buildings never crosses the time limit of four weeks. Moreover, renovation permissions take at-least two months to get approved, whereas for new buildings it takes only a few days after applying on the municipal construction planning website. Betzinger&#8217;s twelve employees are project managers, structural engineers, resource and logistics- or sales managers. The physical work is performed mainly by rented construction robots, supervised by freelancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entering the office of Betzinger, Franz greets the receptionist and goes up to the second floor, where Stefanie awaits him at his desk. &#8220;Hope you have some good news for me?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;Some is good, some is not so good&#8221; Stefanie replies and informs him about the current sales progress. The information about a rejected public tender offer, spoils Franz&#8217; mood: &#8220;How is it even possible that Euro-Bau came up with such a low price?! How can they undercut our offer with current concrete and energy prices? I mean, the production costs are the same everywhere!&#8221;. Competition between the different construction companies in the booming metropolitan areas in Germany is quite fierce. SMEs having a specialization in certain construction processes dominate the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8220;Have enough freelancers applied for the construction site in M&#252;nchen-Pfaffenhofen?&#8221; Franz asks. &#8220;There are still two vacancies online at iConstruct. But all vacancies should be filled by the next week&#8221; Stefanie answers confidently. Franz has thought several times about hiring new employees, but on-demand freelancers skilled to operate Betzinger&#8217;s building robots are the cheaper option. Furthermore, due to uncertainty of the future demand, he is not willing to hire with the strict labor laws a company has to follow for permanent employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "After a cup of coffee, Franz puts on the VR-glasses and swipes with a hand gesture through the different projects his company is currently involved. As long as the little sign in his upper right field of vision lights up green, there is no need to worry: everything works as planned. Sometimes he still commands the tool to provide him with project-specific data or forecasts. Even though the tasks and observations are usually the same, he deems this routine to be necessary, as the multiple partners of his company change for every project. \n",
      "\n",
      "One construction project in the virtual list, however lights up red. An automatic voice immediately tells him that one construction machine stopped working; a worker did not prepare the ground of the construction site properly, leading to the machine accidentally getting stuck and breaking down. Usually there is no need for Franz to go onsite as processes are standardized and run quite smoothly. This time he has to go there. &#8220;I will give this guy a bad rating&#8221; he mumbles while ordering a taxi. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the way to the construction site, Franz quickly checks its current status on his phone. Two subcontractors have already finished their job and sent him the invoices. After checking their work using his VR livestream, he approves their performance and they receive their payment. He also notices that the remaining eight subcontractors simultaneously working on the site should be able to finish their work by the end of the day. A bit more relaxed about the overall process of the project he exits the taxi.\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly feels a vibration and quickly takes two big steps away from the gateway. He didn&#8217;t notice the approaching autonomous truck transporting one of the major wall components from the prefabrication factory. Arriving at the construction site, the truck smoothly stops and one of the workers on site instructs a robot to take over the offloading. Even though autonomously functioning machines and robots have relieved human workers from hard physical work, the industry&#8217;s image is bad owing to the strenuous and poorly paid work on the construction site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the technicians from the robot provider call, stating that they will arrive on-site in five minutes. Franz hopes that they are able to fix the machine quickly on-site so that Betzinger doesn&#8217;t face overruns in time and cost and can avoid the high contractual penalties for delays. Since the rented machines are highly complex and require in-depth operational expertise, Franz relies on the assessment of the specialists. Because of the pressure to finish the house on time, Franz is visibly stressed. Franz reminds himself of the fact that the option to rent those machines instead of investing a lot of money in purchasing the machinery, allowed him to start his own construction business. He manages to calm down and leaves behind his anger about the high dependency on the various micro-players in the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the technicians fix the robot within fifteen minutes because of their high expertise and streamlined, standardized processes. However, the workers on site need to stay longer and Betzinger has to cover the expensive overtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "After finishing work, Franz visits his father in a shared assisted living. They reminisce about how the construction industry has changed since Franz&#8217;s father was a construction worker. His father dislikes how the construction site has developed to a factory-like building process, where everything is automated and timed to the second. Franz&#8217;s father tells his son about how excited he and his wife were when they moved into their first house and how saddened he is by how little people care about their houses since people have stopped buying. Back in his day, people had an appreciation for their home; today people only rent their home and see it as something that has to be as efficient. While going to bed Franz thinks about the industry he works in and how it has changed. Even though he dislikes many parts of the industry, he is still grateful that he has a positive impact on society, environment and people&#8217;s lives.\n",

      "<ideas><idea><title><H1>Conas</H1></title><subtitle><H2>A Virtual Audio Assistant for On-Site Efficiency</H2></subtitle><intro><text>Conas is a cloud-based audio assistance designed for on-site construction workers. With Conas, they are supported in extracting information from complex construction plans and hence, in delivering their assigned tasks efficiently and according to requirements. Construction plans are usually developed as 3D models in architectural software and &#8211; in a steadily increasing number of cases &#8211; implemented in BIM. However, on construction sites, workers still rely on 2D paper-based plans as a source of measurements, material information, and interior object location. Conas provides a digitized solution in translating the information of a construction plan into audio. &#13;\n",
      "From a technical perspective, this solution is enabled by the Conas design-to-speech software. Architects and construction companies upload their BIM and CAD design files to the Conas cloud, which translates every detail of the plans into natural language. The audio of this text is accessible via a smartphone application. Similar to speech assistants, such as Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, construction workers can ask Conas for information about the plan such as measures and materials. Additionally, construction workers can leave comments, e.g. in case of flaw detection. To play the audio and to enable smooth operation, Conas offers noise-canceling earphones and microphone as an optional product bundle. However, the app can connect to any Bluetooth-compatible headphones. &#13;\n",
      "The design of the Conas assistant allows for several functionalities: On the one hand, construction workers can receive information from construction plans while using their hands for the current task. Workers can ask for specific measures or materials without consulting the plan visually or having to recall mental notes. On the other hand, several application programming interfaces (APIs) enable additional services. To overcome language barriers on construction sites, we offer the audio pieces in multiple languages. In addition, text-to-speech services allow construction workers to communicate with the app for the sake of documentation. &#13;\n",
      "The target groups are construction companies of all sizes as well as subcontractors on-site, who are supported during the onboarding process and subsequent project phases. Customers sign up for the service via a monthly subscription for each account. Thus, Conas offers its service to a wide range of firms contributing to the construction process.&#13;\n",

For example, with the increase of smart homes, unfamiliar requirements arise for the worker. Adhering to these requirements means that the workers must be able to extract the correct information from constructions plans. Conas allows users to obtain any information from the construction plan without having to lay aside construction tools, take off gloves or unfold the plan itself. As Conas is based on audio, the user can continue working with his hands while receiving information.\n",
      "Conas provides any detail required at any point in time during the workflow. This controlled flow of information makes it easier for the workers to understand the construction plan as they are no longer overwhelmed with a lot of information from the paper plan. Conas can help any user of a traditional paper plan, from a driller making holes to a worker installing windows.\n",
      "The product also allows the worker to make comments or observations while working. These comments are saved and also available to the supervisor who can then decide how to act on them. This feature allows for a smooth flow of information between workers and supervisors. Moreover, Conas can overcome language barriers which exist on construction sites as construction companies usually employ people from all over the world. As the software supports over 30 different languages, it can translate all information accordingly. Therefore, less time needs to be spent to instruct international employees on plans.  \n",
      "Conas, therefore, provides several benefits: First, the user can execute his task with greater accuracy by receiving precise information from the plans. Second, safety is increased because the user can use both hands for the workflow. Third, by leaving comments, the construction process is better documented. Finally, Conas saves time for the construction worker and hence, increases his productivity. \n",

      "Onboarding: Customer onboarding requires the download of the app and the subsequent connection to the earphones. The app comes with learning videos guiding through the first steps, e.g. the upload of the construction plan. The respective file format needs to be provided by the architect, either via CAD or BIM. For firms that are technically not experienced, Conas offers an implementation service. It includes contacting the architect of the respective project and the upload of the data for the customer. To build strong relationships with lead customers, key accounts are set up, and personal assistance is provided during the first phase of the respective project. For example, on-site training for construction workers is provided. &#13;\n",
      "Project support: Throughout projects, the combination of software, hardware, and interaction with the customer can lead to technical problems. In this case, the app provides a catalog on frequently emerging questions and challenges. If the worker cannot solve the problem himself, support service is available and reachable through the app. In emergency cases, Conas provides on-site support.

Therefore, Conas will utilize various channels to access the market. First, the initial focus will be to reach out to the customer directly. However, as a second strategy, project owners and developers are interesting distribution partners due to their extensive network of architects and construction firms. &#13;\n",
      "Direct channels: Conas markets its product on a B2B basis. The challenge is to convince the representatives of construction firms that are possibly not involved in on-site work. To acquire these firms as customers and to get the product&#8217;s value proposition across, a direct approach is chosen. Conas&#8217; direct sales strategy includes direct mailing and company visits. Besides, to present the product to a larger audience, traditional media, and press, such as trade journals, help to create first touchpoints. Also, construction fairs offer great opportunities for potential customers to test the product. &#13;\n",
      "Indirect channels: The second way to approach customers is via project owners or project development firms.

To establish these functionalities, Conas focuses on four key activities: &#13;\n",
      "Development and maintenance of design-to-speech software and interfaces: The design-to-speech service is Conas&#8217; core feature. Hence, the development is concerned with the translation of CAD and BIM models into audio easily understandable by humans. First, it involves establishing access to all relevant data formats for training and testing. Second, putting this information into speech requires the system to understand the semantics of the CAD/BIM model as well as the semantics of documentation and comments given to certain objects. As a third step, the generated text needs to be transformed into speech by a third-party service provider. The front-end realization of Conas includes a smartphone application for construction workers and the cloud to upload models and plans which contain all data that is accessible via the speech assistant. &#13;\n",
      "Acquisition of software service providers and development of APIs: In addition to creating the Conas software, APIs to external service providers need to be set up. Therefore, an essential part of the business model is the acquisition of reliable partners offering their service for the users of Conas. APIs for BIM and CAD software is necessary to read out plans for information such as measures, materials, and locations. Additionally, APIs for services such as language translation, speech-to-text, and text conversion is required.&#13;\n",
      "Customer acquisition and development of relationships: Entering a broad market with a new product pose challenges for communicating its value proposition to the customer. Therefore, acquiring relevant customers and ensuring their loyalty is decisive for market entry and long-term success. This starts with the development phase by involving construction firms throughout the realization of the product. Marketing and sales efforts are prominent activities, especially during the product launch phase. In the long run, those efforts not only need to be maintained but also improved. &#13;\n",

To offer the product to a wide range of different construction firms, Conas combines a subscription model with a one-time fee for the first setup. &#13;\n",
      "Setup fee: Construction companies pay an initial setup fee dependent on the complexity and size of the underlying construction project. This fee covers the operational assistance. &#13;\n",
      "Subscription model: Conas&#8217; primary revenue streams are subscription fees to get access to the design-to-speech service via a mobile application. This fee depends on the number of accounts required, which reflects the number of construction workers on-site. The payment system is based on a monthly subscription fee to account for short-term projects. This way, entry barriers are kept low for new customers of different sizes. For example, this pricing model allows for flexibility during seasons of less construction activity.  &#13;\n",
      "Hardware component: An additional revenue stream is created by the sale of the hardware component. Earphones equipped with a microphone and noise-canceling feature are bought in bulk and sold to the customer. As the hardware is highly compatible with the software product and features noise cancellation, it improves the performance of Conas significantly in the noisy and vibrating environment on construction sites. Customers are charged once for the component. To attract more customers during the time of market entry, the hardware is also available on a rental basis. &#13;\n",
      "Individual contracts: In case of high usage volume or long-term projects, contracts are negotiated on an individual basis. This procedure comes along with benefits for the customer including discounts, free hardware, or even a tailored solution.

      "Architects and construction firms: To develop and validate the design-to-speech service, industry knowledge is required. Experienced architects in CAD and BIM modeling and data from existing models can provide valuable insight into early-stage software development. The strong connection to the industry enables Conas to create a product that meets the customer&#8217;s needs and guarantees a high-quality standard. &#13;\n",
      "Project owners and project developers: These partners accompany a construction project from the beginning to the very end.

Winning project owners and project developers as partners is a promising distribution channel, not least because of their influence in setting standards on the construction site. &#13;\n",
      "Hardware supplier: Conas focuses on a high-quality software product. However, its performance and user experience are strongly dependent on hardware quality. Therefore, the right partner who can deliver the required quality for the production of earphones and microphones is key. A strong partnership with its hardware provider will allow Conas to influence some of the design and functionality decisions of the manufacturer as well as receive favorable prices. This enables Conas to offer superior hardware at a highly competitive price.&#13;\n",
      "</text></Key_Partners_Text><Customer_Segmentation_Canvas><item>Customer Segments General contractors Subcontractors and specialists Construction workers</item></Customer_Segmentation_Canvas><Customer_Segmentation_Text><text>The Conas software and hardware solution is a product that serves a B2B market and is primarily designed for employed construction workers as the end users. Customers participate in construction projects with complex plans and execute tasks including measurements, material, and positioning. Conas can support the entire workflow of the whole construction process from excavation to electricity and sanitary works. Hence, the product serves a broad share of the construction market. Conas&#8217; customers can be grouped into three sections: &#13;\n",
      "General contractors: General contractors normally offer all construction works from excavation to the turnkey handover and are targeted for two reasons: first, these firms are concerned with a wide range of construction tasks and can use Conas to assist their workers in performing this variety of tasks. Second, subcontracting is a usual practice in this industry. However, the general contractor is still responsible for the project and is tasked with coordination and process monitoring. Thus, the firms can advise or require their subcontractors to use Conas for faster processes and documentation during construction. This way, Conas realizes multiplier effects. &#13;\n",
      "Subcontractors and specialists: The other customer segment consists of smaller companies which are often more specialized and employ fewer workers. Two implications arise for these companies: first, workers do not execute standard tasks and often require special instructions. Second, if only a few workers of a company work on-site, it brings about greater responsibility for the individual. If supervisors or other co-working partners are not available, the worker can make use of the on-site assistance by Conas to fulfill their tasks flawlessly.&#13;\n",
      "Construction workers: Construction workers are indirect customers. Their employers pay for the system, but the workers are the people benefiting directly from it. Conas avoids extra work for the construction workers as they don&#8217;t need to search for the supervisors or the paper plan in case of a problem. Instead, Conas supports them in real-time giving them ad-hoc feedback during the whole construction process. &#13;\n",

While initial investments refer to costs that come along with the development of the product, operational and recurring costs can be split into fixed and variable costs. \n",
      "Initial investments: As with many software products, the initial development of the software requires high upfront investment. To create a viable product, qualified technicians and software developers are required. Further, specialists for CAD and BIM plans consult the technical implementation in how information should be derived from construction plans. The algorithm must be trained to reliably interpret and convert the data into audio information. Furthermore, the acquisition of business partners such as the supplier for earphones is a prerequisite for a hardware offering. Additionally, the use of third-party APIs and software development kits (SDKs) in the software reading out CAD and BIM files, as well as location and translation services, is also a key cost driver. Conas also requires legal advice to clarify possible liabilities. \n",
      "Variable costs: Due to the nature of a B2B market and a large target group, an extensive sales and marketing team including key account management is essential. Marketing experts are tasked to build awareness and create a brand image by developing strategies for the product&#8217;s public presentation, e.g. at construction fairs. For implementation and further customer requests, Conas maintains a call center which incurs further costs. \n",
      "Fixed costs: State-of-the-art software products require continuous improvement and technical innovations in. Therefore, a fixed cost segment includes the maintenance of the software product and R&amp;D investments. The main asset of Conas is a high-quality product that enables fast data transfer without interruption. Thus, an appropriate IT infrastructure and user-friendly interface is key to long-term customer satisfaction. In general, a sufficient operational infrastructure includes office space and further work equipment. Lastly, capital costs are not negligible due to high upfront investments. \n",
      "</text></Cost_Structure_Text><Senario_Fit_1><text>Butler Industry: In a fully-customized world, construction projects are highly individual which results in time-consuming tasks on-site. A highly fragmented market consists of many small companies. Combining both worlds makes it very likely that companies tend to specialize due to the small number of employees and individual requests from customers. Conas provides the highest value in this scenario due to the following reasons: Individual requests by customers result in many unique tasks for construction workers and almost no standards exist. Hence, audio assistance is extremely valuable for construction workers since every plan is entirely different. On top of that, construction companies are striving to gain market power which requires a larger number of employees. Additional support for workers such as Conas can differentiate a company from its competitors when it comes to recruiting. \n",
      "</text></Senario_Fit_1><Senario_Fit_2><text>Construct-mazon: Exchanging the fragmented market with a consolidated market results in a smaller number of construction companies with a larger size each (up to a monopolist that employs every worker). Hence, the need for companies to differentiate themselves from others decreases. Since customization remains on a high level though, Conas is still a good fit for the market. To increase the attractiveness of Conas in this scenario, coordination of workers could add value for customers. For instance, a conversation with Conas about a measure in a specific room indicates that this worker executed a task in this room. In this way, the construction company can have a better overview of how the workers are allocated on the construction site and which tasks they currently face.\n",
      "</text></Senario_Fit_2><Senario_Fit_3><text>Winner builds it all: As opposed to a fully customized world, a fully-standardized world results in very similar construction projects and tasks. Hence, more standards are established and known to construction workers. This decreases the value of Conas to a medium market fit. Nevertheless, this scenario is still a medium fit due to possible adjustments such as the coordination of employees. As standardization increases the usability of automated machines and robots on the construction site, the design-to-speech technology can be adapted to translate digital plans such that machines understand them properly. New building techniques like this can create an advantage over competitors which increases the market share of one player in the market.\n",
      "</text></Senario_Fit_3><Senario_Fit_4><text>Clone Wars: In a fully fragmented and standardized world, companies need to differentiate themselves more than ever from competitors. In comparison to the &#8216;Butler Industry&#8217; scenario, companies tend to specialize less, since more standardization is demanded on the market. Hence, products like Conas can increase the attractiveness of a company on the job market, which is a general goal of all construction companies in this scenario. Just as in the &#8216;Winner builds it all&#8217; scenario, the understanding of plan details like measures and materials can increase the usability of automated machines and robots. Since competition in the construction market is higher in a fragmented scenario, the use of robots can be a critical factor when it comes to gaining market power. Hence, we can increase the value of Conas by additionally offering a translation feature &#8216;design-to-machine&#8217; which is similar to &#8216;design-to-speech.&#8217;\n",

      "</H2></subtitle><intro><text>In the past 50 years, many industries have seen incredible increases in productivity and efficiency. These industries have especially profited from the automation of processes, enabled through embracing new technologies. Contrarily, the construction industry has not seen much innovation in the recent past. As a result, it is one of the few industries that has not improved its processes significantly. The construction industry shows immense potential for increases in efficiency through the use of new technologies, especially the adaptation of connected IoT-devices. However, most useful applications realizing this potential require a specific form of internet connection, which is in most cases not sufficiently available on construction sites at the moment.&#13;\n",
      "Craidar helps to solve this issue for large and medium-sized construction sites by providing two modules: a Wifi-Module delivering a reliable and fast internet connection to construction sites and a LIDAR-Module enabling the tracking of the construction of the building shell. If a crane is available on the construction site, the Wifi-Module will be mounted on top of the crane. As soon as there is no crane available anymore, the module should be attached to a central and relatively high point on the construction site. Depending on the location and possibilities for providing data in the particular area of the construction site, there are three ways to supply the module: Landline, cellular networks, and satellites. For an optimal connection, especially on large construction sites, the Wifi-Module can be reinforced through amplifiers. These allow the use of IoT-devices, as well as increased automation on construction sites. &#13;\n",
      "The LIDAR-Module will be installed in the crane boom on the trolley, with which it will move along. After the disassembly of the crane, the LIDAR-sensor provides no additional benefit, since the shell of the building is finished and most changes are now done inside the building. LIDAR-sensors and cameras in the module generate a point-cloud and a 3D-model of the construction site. Craidar will provide an API for manufacturers of BIM- and project-management-software so that the models can be used for automated comparisons of the BIM model with the constructed building shell, as well as automated tracking of the adherence to the planned building process. Also, detection of workers and building material could be improved when utilizing automated crane steering, leveraging the data generated by the sensors.&#13;\n",

These groups share an interest in a more connected and better-steered construction site, making them the perfect partners for a revenue-share sales partner model. It will be necessary to incentivize crane manufacturers to offer our module with the sale of a crane. In the long run, Craidar will have to negotiate contracts and conditions that enable software companies to use the results of the LIDAR-module and to have a large number of software companies using the results from the LIDAR-Module. \n",

For complex building sites, the unit comes with software providing an optimal strategy for setting up the module together with additional amplifiers. The additional amplifiers can be bought or leased. They will be provided through an external partner with Craidar adjusting these for the use on construction sites to ensure an optimal connectivity coverage. The combined forces of the Wifi-Module and advanced amplifying systems ensures a high-quality network.&#13;\n",
      "A second revenue stream will come from selling and leasing the LIDAR-System together with a basic 3D-software, making sense of the data generated so that they can be used by other applications. The LIDAR-System requires the purchase of the WIFI-System. The price of the system depends on the type of crane used and the type of sensors built into the crane. The classical hardware components can be purchased together with cranes to enable more use cases. The earnings are generated by direct sales of the module and will make up most of the revenues generated.&#13;\n",

      "Craidar will also make revenue from the consumed data. In cooperation with existing telecommunication providers, Craidar allows choosing between different offerings of selected data packages or flats suited to the needs of construction sites. Craidar will negotiate the terms and conditions as part of a frame agreement and sell the access to the target group to selected telecommunication providers.&#13;\n",
      "Lastly, Craidar derives revenue streams from services around the system.

For the Wifi-Module, Craidar will acquire the required antennas, cables, satellite dishes, as well as other hardware components from third-party providers. There is a large number of suppliers available for these components. For the LIDAR-Module, Craidar will produce weather- and a wind-proof case containing all LIDAR-Sensors and cameras. The LIDAR-modules are offered in different types according to the height of the crane and its technical specifications. &#13;\n",
      "Telecommunications providers: For the Wifi-Module to be functional, telco providers are required to provide an internet connection for the construction site. There are three major ways to supply the Wifi-Module with data. For construction sites with an already developed infrastructure, a landline is the optimal solution. For remote construction sites with no landline connection, cellular-networks will be used. If no cellular networks are available, satellite-connection serves as the last option.&#13;\n",
      "Manufacturers of construction machines and IoT-devices: Increased availability of IoT-devices for the construction site will raise usefulness and profitability of the Wifi-Module for clients. Since there is currently only a small number of these devices available, Craidar will partner with manufacturers of construction machines to promote machines using IoT-technologies to enable the tracking of usage, predictive maintenance, and other use cases. These partnerships will in return also promote the Craidar-System.&#13;\n",

For the large construction companies to function properly, they need to have well-organized structures and processes. Especially in the construction of fully customized houses, the delay is common, and companies need always to know the status of a project to plan. Due to the highly customized designs, companies also need an easy way to track if the building is constructed according to the plan. Craidar allows companies to track the process while erecting the shell of a building and use this knowledge to manage workers and delivery of material accordingly. It allows these companies to automate the monitoring of the alignment of plan and reality during the construction of the outer shell.&#13;\n",
