[1] Hence, the industry first has to catch up with technology trends which are already implemented in other industries before applying latest technologies. Two of those fundamental technology trends that should be adapted are the digitalization of existing processes including data collection and the use of suitable software for communication and collaboration. This general digitalization does not only enable the implementation of more advanced technologies in the future, it is also essential for construction companies right now in order to stay competitive. One example is the requirement for Building Information Modeling (BIM) in public infrastructure projects from 2020 onwards. [2] Additionally, companies can profit from an efficiency increase by digitalizing their processes. [3]\\nOnce processes such as communication, collaboration are data collection are sufficiently digitalized, the industry can focus on more advanced technology trends. Namely, the automation of processes and the use of wearables and exoskeletons. The automation of processes refers to the use of robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and 3D-printers, mainly for the fabrication and building process of construction projects. The use of those devices results in more efficient work, less material costs and most importantly it compensates for scarcity of workforce. [3], [4] , [5] Wearables and exoskeletons approach the problem of scarce workforce from another side. Wearables can further develop the process of data collection as an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to increase safety for workers. [6] Exoskeletons support human workforce by making their day-to-day job physically less demanding and therefore less prone for injuries. Altogether, the attractiveness of construction jobs increases with the use of wearables and exoskeletons.\\nIn a further step, high-tech trends such as the use of the visualization technologies augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be specifically applied in the context of BIM. While VR especially adds value in the planning phase, the use of AR has a large potential during the building process. AR can help construction companies to prevent misunderstandings with both, sub-contractors and customers. This is of large impact since changes at the end of the building process are very expensive and a significant pain point for construction companies. [7] The use of artificial intelligence (AI) requires vast amounts of data of high quality. Therefore, this trend will be relevant in an even later step than visualization technologies. The increase of efficiency in terms of coordination and productivity of tasks is the main application in this field. [8]\\n</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Maximilian Deichmann\">\\n<H2>Construction Automation</H2>\\n<H3>Automation of repetitive tasks enables workers to focus on complex duties.</H3>\\n<Text>\\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), such as drones, robotics and additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing, will offer construction companies opportunities to improve efficiency [9].\\nFirst, in the 1980s UAVs emerged by spraying pesticides on Japanese rice fields. Since then, the technology advanced and is now disrupting industries from filmmaking to infrastructure [10]. In the construction industry, UAVs can help to assess properties on their development potential or to track progress on construction sites. This is done by comparing the data captured by UAVs with the BIM [11].\\nSecond, 3D printing came up in the 1980s as well, when Hideo Kodama published a paper about it in 1981 [12]. Researchers advanced the technology so that there are multiple manufacturing techniques and printing materials available today. Nowadays it is used in multiple industries, for example the aerospace industry to build jet engine parts [13], [14]. 3D printing is highly effective, if specialized small scale products have to be built – such as in the construction industry [13]. In fact, first houses have been built by 3D printers with the help of robots to move the print head, but there are still some technological hurdles to take to reach product maturity [15], [16].\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• A survey among mainly North American companies in the construction industry revealed that 37.8% of them experiment with UAVs, while another 10.2% experiment with additive manufacturing [17].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The global construction market size for business solutions addressable by UAVs amounts to 45 bn USD, which includes flying over a construction site and tracking the progress [10].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• UAVs are already used on construction sites and increasing efficiency [4].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A shell construction single-family house can be built by a 3D printer in 10 hours while three workers would need 6 days leading to cost reductions by up to 30 [18].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• German government increasingly encourages construction companies to use BIM [18].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The current building processes prevent efficiency increases which can be solved with the help of automation [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to physical stress and health security concerns on construction sites, it will become increasingly difficult to attract workers [20].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Advances in high resolution and light weight cameras and sensors, battery lifetime and autopilot navigation enable advancements in UAV technologies [11].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, robotic technologies are increasingly finding applications in the construction industry, because they are learning to operate in unstructured environments [19].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Depending of the application of UAVs, they would film entire construction sites and therefore the workers, which means that privacy issues need to be considered [11].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In order to use additive manufacturing in mass production, researchers still need to improve on different issues, for example the composition of concrete to let it dry faster [15].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Robots are capital intensive and therefore pose a financial challenge for construction companies [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Buildings need to be planned with the purpose to build them automated, which needs to be enforced by management [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Robots need to be capable of handling complex and uncontrolled environments on construction sites [19].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The automation of the building processes addresses the problem of finding employees and leads to efficiency increases. Automated construction sites are less dangerous and require skilled workers to work with new technologies, which increases the job attractiveness [21], [5]. Furthermore, there are examples of how automation can improve efficiency. Additive manufacturing for example can save up to 60% in material, 80% in workforce and 70% in time [3]. Furthermore, UAVs are able to reduce costs, increase safety and improve data quality on the construction site [10].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Sebastian Sabbadini\">\\n<H2>Digitalization and Data Collection</H2>\\n<H3>Digitalizing existing processes and data to profit from technological progress</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIt is a generally accepted fact that digitalization has been one of the major driver behind the increase in productivity taking place in most industries in the past decade. Still, it can be observed that there is a large discrepancy between the rise in productivity in the German construction industry, where this measures only 4.1%, and related industries such as manufacturing, which has improved on average by 34.1% over the last 10 years. [3] Therefore, one can draw the conclusion that it is imperative for construction companies to tightly integrate software if they are to reach similar levels of growth. The conversion of standard processes to a software-based approach represents only a first step towards the goal of digitalization, the next one consists in the collection of data through a variety of sensors. The information about many aspects of the development cycle collected in this way may seem to have little worth on its own, but the advent of sophisticated data analysis algorithms opens up a world of possibilities in the fields of monitoring, prediction, optimization and automation.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In the construction industry 93% of players agree that digitalization will affect every process in their value chain. [22]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Less than 6% of German construction companies fully rely on digital planning tools in their process workflow. [3]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In Germany, the call for tenders is already issued electronically for 80% to 90% of public construction projects. [3]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In half of the construction companies in the DACH  region, less than 40% of the employees don’t own a smartphone. [2]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Digital platforms allow savings of around 5% for catalog-based purchases and around 10% in the case of online auctions [3]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The EU  promotes digital calls for tender for public construction projects, because of their transparency and efficiency. [3]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Cloud-based mobile apps are favored by the availability of low-cost mobile connectivity. [1]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The emergence of IoT will allow to connect both machines and workers and allow to collect immense amounts of data.</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The German Federal Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure prescribes the mandatory use of BIM in public infrastructure projects as of 2020. [2]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Defining standardized digital solutions for diverse construction scenarios is a difficult task. [1]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Scaling software that is useful to construction companies differing in size and sophistication level or only function as subcontractors is another challenge. [1]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Decision makers in construction are often very skeptical towards the adoption of digital tools believing that this is impracticable due to the uniqueness of each project. [1]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In the short term there will be compatibility issues between emerging software solutions from different software manufacturers. [23]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Construction sites often experience a lack of reliable and high-speed broadband connectivity. [1]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Digitization will influence every part in the value chain. It will redefine the planning process by including more information gathered through IoT devices such as wearables and will make sure that all the stakeholders are aligned with the process. [23] To this end, BIM software will finally substitute paper plans to create “digital twins”. [24], [25] Using digital solutions will help construction managers to easily keep track of the proceedings by reducing their effort drastically. [2] Mapping technologies such as GPS, LiDAR,  and photogrammetry will be used for surveying and provide vast information about the building terrain and later the building itself. [1] Lastly, digital solutions will improve customer relationship, by analyzing customer data and offer tailor-made services.

An exoskeleton is a wearable mobile machine which supports the muscles of the carrier and therefore enhances his ability to do physically demanding jobs.\\r\\nWearables are already used in industries like health care, manufacturing, mining and athletics to monitor and increase the safety. [26] Not only athletes use it to monitor hearth rates to gain real time feedback about their performance [27] but also the mining industry uses proximity warning systems based on GPS to prevent collisions between mining equipment, small vehicles, and stationary structures. [28] \\r\\nWearables and exoskeletons can be added to the apparel of construction workers to confront the problem of high safety risks typical for this industry [29] and to prevent long term injuries such as dorsal pain. For instance, the exoskeletons can be applied where workers have to lift heavy machinery and materials. [30] The wearable technologies can cover in- and outdoor scenarios so that the tracking of the actual position of workers is possible. In addition wearables provide the individual users with useful services and information while they are still able to perform other tasks in parallel. [31]\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The construction industry has the third most accidents at work. [32] On German construction sites 104,820 work related accidents happened in the year 2016.

The reason for this is that machine learning, clustering, and image recognition are very flexible methods which provide precise and valuable insights into complex processes. [50] Indeed, they can adapt to their environment and solve tasks that usually require a certain degree of human intelligence. As AI algorithms are increasingly evolving towards mature computational methods, more and more industries are adopting them. Among these industries, several such as manufacturing and transportation are adjacent to the construction industry or at least share similar processes. [51] Following their example, the construction industry will have to adopt these technologies and will, as a consequence, experience considerable relief of its processes with cost and time overruns representing two major shortcomings in daily procedures. [52] By having intelligent software tackling the complexity of construction projects, procedures can be simplified, time schedules optimized, and multiple tasks automated. [51] Nonetheless, the adoption of AI in the near future is expected to happen only at a very slow pace. [53] Yet, increased labor shortage, low productivity [54] and the rising competition from new, by AI-powered market entrants will steer the industry in this new direction.

[56] Hence, the number of software which offers cloud-based solutions increased significantly over the same time. With cloud services, shared data can be accessed from wherever there is internet connection. Therefore, devices no longer have to be in a specific physical location in order to access data. Other advantages that a lot of cloud-based software solutions offer are features such as real-time collaboration or version control. These features allow multiple parties to work on the same file simultaneously.\\nIn 2016, LTE coverage reached 96 % of all households in Germany. [57] This does not only increase mobile availability but also allows fast use of cloud-based software solutions from almost everywhere in Germany. \\nIn the future, one application of remote collaboration which might be particular interesting for the industry is the collaboration in BIM. As BIM is continuously penetrating the market, it is expected that it will gain more relevance in the future especially for the building phase. [2] In that case, a collaboration solution for BIM that allows all relevant stakeholders to work on the same file seamlessly might be of big impact.\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The company Datarella (a provider for blockchain solutions based in Munich) successfully tested an automated blockchain system for arbitration procedures.

Today, buildings serve more than just as a basic need. Construction nowadays also reflects the social and cultural status of a society including values, lifestyles, and desires of individuals. With people adapting to economic, technological, and social changes, building concepts are also constantly being redefined. Identifying emerging behavior patterns contributes to the development of future-oriented buildings and construction methods. In this report, we describe six trends that are expected to impact the construction industry in two aspects: First, they give an outlook on possible future design and properties of buildings relevant to a broad share of society. Second, they cover the way, the work patterns in construction is likely to change. \\n\\nOne of the key changes in consumer behavior is the shift towards customization. Consumers are increasingly demanding individualized products that reflect their personal aesthetic preferences and meet their individual needs. This development challenges the construction industry with a trade-off: While firms can differentiate themselves in offering unique products, this trend affects the efficiency of construction.\\n\\nIn addition, the demands of a highly mobile and fast paced generation have led to the emergence of the service economy. Enabled by digitalization, people strive for time-saving solutions in both living and working environments that offer optional services on-demand. These new consumer patterns challenge companies to offer all-in-one solutions, that enable an easy and flexible lifestyle. \\n\\nSustainability is ubiquitous in almost every aspect of our lives. Pressures to reduce CO2 emissions and a growing public awareness to reduce the ecological footprint foster green building activities. These refer to the design, construction, and operation of buildings, that allow to reduce negative impacts on the natural environment. New energy efficient materials and systems foster this trend.\\n\\nFor urban environments, new concepts to tackle the high influx of people to cities include a reduction of living space per capita. Central aspects of this trend include the shortage of affordable living space, the singularization of households, and the conscious consumer who is less focused on material possessions. These developments require solutions for small scale living. \\n\\nHuman factors are critical performance drivers in the construction industry. In addition to the aforementioned consumer patterns, change can be observed in workforce-mindset as well. Paying close attention to changes in employees’ expectations is crucial. Currently, the share of millennials and generation Z members with different life perspectives and values is growing in society. Consequently, firms are challenged to attract and retain this highly capable cohort of the future workforce. \\n\\nThe German society faces an increased variety in the cultural background of its members. Migration is the key driver of this development. This increased multiculturalism poses challenges concerning integration and language barriers. It is likely that cultural differences will affect the construction industry as a provider of community space and employer.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Simon Höferlin\">\\n<H2>Space as a service</H2>\\n<H3>Concept of flexible, on-demand and serviced living space</H3>\\n<Text>\\nWe are moving towards a generation for which it is natural that ownership is not a prerequisite for using something. Moreover, this generation is used to receive services and goods flexibly, on-demand, and with a simple and fast process tailored to their current needs. Increased mobility in both private and professional life leads to a generation that is less settled down than previous generations. As a result, there is a higher demand for flexible living space. Those characteristics especially apply to the “Sinus Milieus” of the “Performers”, “Adaptive Navigators”, and “Cosmopolitan Avantgarde” [63] which make up to one quarter in society with higher social status and re-orientation regarding their basic values. They desire having multiple options, accelerated lives, and are pragmatic and explorative [63] but also more stressed [64], [65]. Manifestations of this trend are for instance the growth of AirBnB, for flexible rent contracts or the rise of Co-Working spaces [66] like WeWork, offering flexible workplaces plus add-on services and a vibrant community. In a similar way, WeLive is offering “Co-Living” with flexible serviced apartments including a community life, a gym and other perks [67], [68], [69], [70], [71].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The share of 20 to 29-year-old Germans planning to buy a house decreased from 52% in 2010 to 38% in 2017 [72]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The worldwide number of coworking spaces has risen from 160 in 2008 to over 18,600 [66] reflecting the demand for fast and flexible, all-in-one solutions</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 68% agreed to the statement “the business model of real estate investors is changing as a result of the move towards ‘space as a service’” [73]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing post-materialism can be observed which is described as the “shifting from an over-whelming emphasis on material well-being and physical security toward greater emphasis on the quality of life” [74], [75] Digitalization enables on-demand products and services such as online platforms and configurators [76] Mobility of people will most likely increase [77] and therefore the need for flexible living space Business models shift from ownership to service-oriented models [78]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Customers’ on-demand and high service expectations need to be met by the organization of construction projects</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A requirement will be to offer an all-in-one solution with an attractive design, flexibility and demanded add-on services adapting to the customer’s current needs</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Without a holistic perspective, construction companies might miss important data to optimize what customers want, especially when not being vertically integrated and iterative</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• First, the spotted trend changes what customers desire in design aspects of buildings, such as pre-furnished and serviced apartments as well as common areas to foster community life and pre-installed smart-home gadgets. Second, customers transfer their expectations of mainly digital, on-demand products, being in essence the seamless, flexible, and fast processes, to the construction industry. The construction industry needs to find ways for making the process of building a house, or more general, utilizing living space, easier and faster to meet private customer’s rising expectations [79].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kaya Dreesbeimdiek\">\\n<H2>Downsizing Living Space</H2>\\n<H3>New concepts to reduce living space per capita in urban environments</H3>\\n<Text>\\nLiving space is being rethought in urban areas. As more and more people start to embrace the benefits of metropolitan life, living space is becoming a scarce and expensive resource [80]. People have started to recognize the need for more efficiency and are willing to trade individual living space for proximity to the city center, lower costs, and availability of housing as well as for reduced energy usage. As a result, the trend of reducing living space per capita frees up capacities to offer house to more people and to cut energy consumption, e.g. by not sealing ground any further [81]. This development gives rise to new concepts such as minimalistic, multifunctional, and shared approaches. These concepts aim to create more compact living space while maintaining a high quality of life [82]. Moreover, they account for changes in demographics and family structures. Higher life expectancy and the tendency of young people to delay traditional life choices, e.g. marriage and having children, creates need for accommodation tailored to individual life situations [80]. Therefore, it is likely that the demand for attractive solutions for small scale living will further increase and affect a great share of society [83]. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In 77 German cities, around 1.9m affordable apartments are missing with 1.4m apartments among them referring to one person households under 45 square meters [84]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2050, 80% of Germans are expected to live in urban areas [85]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Compared to the previous-year period, investments for student housing and micro apartments rose by 224% to 1.6bn EUR in Germany during the first half of 2018 [86]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Average age at which German women have their first child increased from 24 in the 1970s to 29.6 in 2016 reflecting postponed family formation [87]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• There are currently 762 realized and 254 planned community living projects in Germany [88]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Scarcity of building ground, regulations, and rising construction costs shortens affordable living space in urban areas [89]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A less resource-intense lifestyle and new business models like the sharing economy allow society to reduce personal possessions [90]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Environmental awareness makes society consider the energy consumption and waste production associated with living space [91], [92]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The singularization of households, especially among the elderly, possesses huge potential to reduce living space for an individual [93]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The individualization of society and greater prosperity lead to higher demands for living quality [94]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Elderly people show a reduced residential mobility as they tend not to move into smaller housing, even though their life situation changes and the number of household member decreases [95], [93]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Community and participation in living space can emerge only if the need for individuality and privacy is sufficiently satisfied [82]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Living space needs to be adaptable for different groups of a society and their current phase of life [80]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The shift to smaller living space will change room concepts and hence, the designs of buildings. Due to requirements of reduced, flexible, and shared space, construction may go beyond buildings’ mere creation. This has important implications for the industry: Firms may get involved with concepts from interior design such as built-in furniture, and flexible elements like movable walls. Moreover, to keep costs low, modularization and serial construction will become more important. Additionally, quality and design standards will get into focus. Hence, the capability to use innovative materials and shapes is an opportunity for construction firms to differentiate themselves.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Ibrar Arshad\">\\n<H2>Increasing Selectivity in Employer Choice</H2>\\n<H3>Millennials and Generation Z Members are Reluctant to Join Old-school Employers</H3>\\n<Text>\\nMillennials (born post 1980) and Generation Z (born post 1995) will constitute the majority of the global future workforce [96], [97].

Mass customization and the use of standardized modules have the potential for meeting both objectives [111]. Recent social and cultural developments challenge the housing industry reflecting a divergence between customer expectations and building design. Whereas consumer demands tend to be heterogeneous, physical buildings are still largely homogenous [112]. As a result of the complexities involved in the estimating, production, delivery, and management processes, most homebuyers choose from a limited number of standard products offered by large production builders. Alternatively, they pay a significant price premium for a customized building realized by a smaller custom builder. As customization options drive consumer satisfaction for their industrialized homes, the tradeoff between production efficiency and great customer satisfactions ratings becomes apparent [113]. Successful adaptations of mass customizations in the building industry can be found in the Japanese prefabrication industry, which operates rather like a production industry than a construction industry and combines automation, products and services into their business models [114].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• First initiatives for using smart contracts in the construction industry were launched in the US, e.g. BuildCoin [115]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing use of smart sensors in combination with big data algorithms provides structured data about occurring events and changes.

National companies might be forced to adjust their differentiation strategies to compete with the flexibilities of local contractors. Local contractors might need to adapt production and service innovations introduced by national companies [118]. Modular construction could be introduced as a method of construction which increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the buildings by combining conventional construction techniques with modern mass production models. This could mean that a major portion of the construction work is shifted to high-tech, weather independent factories [119].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Mathis Stolz\">\\n<H2>Green Building</H2>\\n<H3>Sustainable Design and the Application of a Building Lifecycle Perspective</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry accounts for the largest share in the use of natural resources regarding the use of land and extraction of materials. In Europe, buildings account for around 40% of primary energy consumption and therefore significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions [120]. Consequently, a good understanding of the nature and structure of energy use in buildings is crucial for establishing the adequate future energy and climate change policies [121]. Green building applies a whole life cycle perspective during the design process and considers siting, energy efficiency, materials efficiency and water efficiency as key elements [122]. Measures and methods of building green include energy management systems for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) optimization, passive building design and the use of sustainable building materials [123], [124]. Ideally, sustainable building should bring added value for the owners, investors and project developers as well as for the users of the property. This value includes energy savings and related cost reductions over the lifecycle of the building as well as a higher perceived quality of living. But high direct investment costs and a lack of information on energy-efficient solutions at all levels of the value creation chain are obstacles to overcome.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, there are three accepted certificate systems in Germany (DGNB, LEED, BREEAM) with the public DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council) having a market share of over 60% [125]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Investment in Green Buildings in Germany increased more than tenfold from 600m EUR in 2008 to 7.4bn EUR in 2016 [125]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2017, there were 830 buildings certified as sustainable in Germany compared to 4,206 in UK and 1,397 in France [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• About 50% of certified buildings in Germany are office buildings [125]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2017, the KfW committed over 14bn EUR in funding to energy-efficient construction and renovation [126]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Public awareness regarding the importance of sustainability drives investment in green building projects [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Better energy efficiency resulting in cost savings might yield higher financial returns on buildings [127]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Realizable sustainability premiums in rent prices drives profitability of projects [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Green building materials, mechanical systems, and furnishings have become more widely available, and their prices have dropped considerably, decreasing direct capital costs [123]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Increased productivity in green office buildings is an important aspect of the overall business case to be made for green building [123], [124], [128]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The incentive for corporates to build green is still mostly based on profitability and marketing effects [129]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Higher direct capital costs of green buildings affordability is a key challenge [130]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Effects of green buildings on prices are difficult to calculate, owing to the heterogeneity of building types and the lack of experience.

While big construction companies and real estate funds might have the financial resources to pioneer green projects, smaller players in the value chain of the construction industry need to invest in developing sustainable solutions. Further, intense collaboration and interdisciplinary project teams are crucial to a successful planning and design process [123]. As the green building trend progresses, it is also important to consider its value depreciating impact on normal buildings. To mitigate this development, building owners should invest in renovations and recycling techniques [123], [127].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Benedict Gruber\">\\n<H2>Migration</H2>\\n<H3>Language and other barriers in the working place</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe effect of language on the integration of migrants is a commonly discussed topic in politics throughout the world.

Laws and ordinances constantly influence the building process, right from planning and construction to demolition and recycling, existing on various levels: EU, federal, state, and communal. The EU issues directives that need to be implemented as laws by European countries within a certain time frame. To foster these laws, the German government may issue additional ordinances that describe the specifications of how a law should be implemented implemented in a specific region, for certain goods or in a specific industry. By identifying governmental policies, regulations and incentives, the following illustrates future trends in owing to political and legal factors, concerning the construction industry. \\n\\nThe past few decades have witnessed an increase in the environmental awareness and international commitments for ensuring a greener future on an individual as well as institutional level. As a result, the German government has ratified several regulations regarding increasing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction industry.\\n \\nAnother environmental trend goes towards more standardized waste management regulations. In Germany, there still exist a multitude of differing ordinances on communal and state level. New laws are planned to harmonize those regulations and will create an up-to-date, for all states unified legal basis.\\n \\nIncreasingly empowered citizens are driving environmentally conscious policies. Through a growing number of referendums, public participation in the decision-making process has been on the rise and citizens have influence on large construction projects. In recent years, a lack of transparency and information to the public has led to the failure of many construction projects.\\n\\nDuring the last decade, a discrepancy between government and municipality spending has led to a large number of underutilized government funds. This has resulted in a delay of many critical infrastructure initiatives, i.e. the expansion of broadband and electricity grids. Now, a strengthened financial situation of German municipalities indicates an increased demand for public construction projects.\\n\\nWith a high demand for construction projects, pressure for innovation is low. This has led to the German construction industry being slower in the adoption of technological advances than most other industries. The current government has often tried to encourage digitalization, especially through the use of BIM. Task forces are being dedicated to the promotion of BIM and governmental regulations are being passed requiring companies to use BIM for infrastructure projects.\\n\\nEven though the construction industry is slow in adapting to digitization, technologies promise faster execution and less risk in planning and safety. However, underlying data privacy regulations are necessary to foster the new innovations. Growing collaboration opens up new questions regarding intellectual property, data privacy and security of data flow.\\n \\nAnother technology that might have an impact on the building process are “Smart Contracts” that change the way contracts are managed. These self-executing protocols will optimize the current process and make it more transparent and reliable. Therefore, politicians and legislators should consider how to cope with the legal impediments and encourage the adoption of intelligent contracting.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Marissa Rimmele\">\\n<H2>Citizen Empowerment</H2>\\n<H3>Rising willingness and opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision-making process</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the past decade, large-scale infrastructure projects have been increasingly present in the public eye. People protesting “Stuttgart 21” and the construction of a third runway at the Munich airport have been highly publicized. Oftentimes, high costs or environmental consequences of a project lead to public outrage, which may result to public referendums. If a referendum is successful, it can paralyze construction projects. Even “Stuttgart 21” was continued, protests led to a delay of almost a year [142]. In Munich, a referendum prevented an additional runway for the airport [143]. In addition, the public influence on city planning is increasing. In 2004, a referendum in Munich decided that no building in the city is allowed to be higher than 100 m. Ten years later, a referendum regarding the development of the abandoned airport Tempelhof declined the construction of residential housing on in the peripheral area [144]. A lack of transparency and information of the public has led to the failure of many projects. With increasing willingness of the public to engage in the decision-making process, the influence of public opinion on construction processes is increasing and needs to be considered during planning and construction [145].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Municipal petitions for a referendum and citizens’ decisions have increased since the 1990s from less than 50 procedures a year to around 300 procedures in 2015 [145]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• From 1995 to 2015 there have been 2,727 referendums in Bavaria, almost 40% of all referendums in Germany [145]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 67% of German Citizens want to participate in the decision-making process [146]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2001, the Aarhus Convention went into effect, providing a right for “access to environmental information” and “public participation in environmental decision-making“ [147]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• For the election in 2018, all parties in the Bavarian Parliament (CSU, CDU, the Green-Party and the Free-Voters-Party) state plan to include citizens in important decisions, with an emphasis on decisions regarding development of cities and residential constructions [148], [149], [150], [151]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Regulations for referendums are becoming increasingly citizen-friendly with less exclusion of topics, lowering the of required signatures and prolonging of deadlines for the collection of signatures [145]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Results of referendums are greatly accepted by the public and enjoy a high legitimacy [145] Willingness of the public to participate in the political decision-making process is increasing [145]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• “Not in my backyard”-mentality: lack of interest for projects as long as citizens are not affected directly, as well as low general acceptance for large scale infrastructure projects [152]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Growing complexity of projects makes it more difficult for citizens to be informed [153]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 29% of referendums are declared as inadmissible, often because of restrictive case law, lack of experience by initiators as well as a high number of required signatures [145]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Participation-paradox: Increasing public interest and engagement with increasing progress in the construction progress with a decreasing possibility for participation [152]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Especially in local projects, the influence of public opinion will grow.

Transparency and continuous involvement of the public might help contain protests and decrease the feeling of arbitrary decision-making by politicians [152]. If communities do not feel involved in the construction process, citizens initiatives can slow down or stop a project [145].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Marissa Rimmele\">\\n<H2>Promotion of BIM-Usage</H2>\\n<H3>Governmental measures for increased utilization of BIM </H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe German construction industry has been relatively slow in adapting to digitalization. Compared to other EU countries, Germany is far behind, especially, regarding the implementation of BIM [18]. In a study conducted by the Fraunhofer-Institute, almost one fifth of people working in the German construction industry did not know the planning method BIM, with only 14% of respondents working with BIM for more than a year. When planners were questioned about their usage of BIM, only 40% of the respondents said that they use BIM more or less frequently [43].\\nEngland is one of the Europe’s leaders in BIM implementation, having already started a BIM-Strategy in 2007. Since 2016 BIM Level 2 is required for all public projects, as well as for the public tender process [154]. This results in only 16% of construction companies in England having never worked with BIM [155]. Currently, Germany following in the same direction, actively making efforts to foster the standardized usage of BIM. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In an effort to standardize BIM-usage, the German Ministry for Traffic and Infrastructure (BMVI) published BIM guidelines in 2013 [156]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• On European level a standardization committee is responsible for the standard specifications for the use of BIM, as well as the definition of rules for the handling of the resulting data [155]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, there are several pilot projects using BIM commissioned by public authorities [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The minimization of risk regarding cost overrun and missed deadlines through utilization of BIM is states as a major goal in the coalition agreement between CSU, CDU and SPD (2017-2021) [157]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Gradual scheme by the BMVI: Application of BIM Level I is required for all new projects commissioned by the BMVI starting 2020 [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Stagnation in productivity and efficiency in the construction industry [158]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Slow adoption of the construction industry to digitalization [158]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Increasingly large infrastructure projects require reliable planning methods [158]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Need for early detection of mistakes on construction sites and decrease of risk in the construction process [159]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Little transparency between construction companies and subcontractors [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Slow adoption of innovative technologies by the construction companies [158]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Low technology affinity of the construction industry as well as a lack of training regarding modern technology [158]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• High fragmentation of the German construction industry and the resulting high number of small- and medium-sized construction companies, making investments in BIM difficult [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Low number of pilot projects involving small or medium companies increasing difficulty to gain experience with BIM [18]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• With the introduction of BIM into the construction process, projects will become far more cooperative. For this cooperation to work, projects will have to become more transparent and contracts for projects using BIM should include clear provisions for integrated, cooperative and transparent operations [18]. With an increasing need for investment in BIM, smaller companies might get a competitive disadvantage and will need to adapt, i.e. through cooperation with bigger companies [159]. Other results of BIM utilization in construction projects might be an increase of productivity and efficiency, as well as reduction of planning risks for infrastructure projects [158].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Joana Haase\">\\n<H2>Standardized Waste Management Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Unified waste disposal regulations at a federal level</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction sector is one of the most resource intensive economic sectors and generates more than 54% of all waste in Germany [160]. The EU Waste Directive of 2008 paved the way for more unified laws and regulations regarding waste management in the EU countries. Every country needs to ensure that waste is disposed in a hierarchical way, depending on the degree of pollution, and that at least 70% of all construction and demolition waste is recycled by 2020 [161]. Despite those regulations, the increasing amount of waste will be a challenge for the future and landfilling capacities are already saturated in Bavaria. Also, there is no standardized ordinance for all German states. To address this, a new ordinance (“Mantelverordnung”) is planned in the near future [162].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act (“Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz”) is being developed since 1994 and was customized to the requirements of the EU Waste Directive [163].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2014, Germany generated more than 200 million tons of mineral building waste [164].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Despite the recycling rate of 88% [165], landfills for remaining construction waste are rare and expensive in Bavaria [166].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Since 2005 the German parliament plans a new ordinance for all German states concerning the usage of recycled material and new limit values for waste disposal [162].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The total amount of construction rubble in Germany increased by 13 % since 2010 and is estimated to further increase in the future [167] [168]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to a landfill shortage in Bavaria, more building rubble will be transported to distant landfills leading to rising transportation costs [168]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The prices for locale waste disposal in Bavaria will go up due to landfill shortage  [168]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• As limit value regulations for waste disposal vary from state to state, administrative efforts will be high, if a state cannot dispose its waste locally but needs to deposit it in a different German state</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• If the government implements stricter limit values in the course of new waste management regulations, more waste will be deposited and no longer recycled.

However, the government takes more time than planned to decide on the new regulations</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The new waste management regulation (“Mantelverordnung”) will entail unified limit values for the disposal of construction waste in all German states. Furthermore, the usage of recycled material will be regulated on a national level [169]. This will lead to less administrative costs. Compared to Bavaria, most German states have stricter limit values for polluted soil. Hence, the “Mantelverordnung” might cause tighter regulations for Bavarian construction companies, when it comes to standardization. Consequently, fewer waste can be recycled and more waste will be disposed. This might entail disposal bottlenecks in Bavaria and higher waste disposal costs for Bavarian construction companies [168].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Shiv Contractor\">\\n<H2>Increasing Energy Efficiency Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Climate change awareness and long-term energy goals are engendering higher energy efficiency</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the recent spate of urbanization, there has been a rapid rise in the per capita energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and waste generation.

Over the past couple of decades, Germany has passed several legislations apropos of decreasing energy consumption (on an industry as well as individual level), increasing energy efficiency, and incorporating renewable energies into the power grid [171]. Due to the infrastructural changes pursuant to these regulations, the construction industry is either directly or indirectly involved in these small, medium, and large-scale projects.\\nMoreover, there has been a notable surge in the awareness of environmental issues among the general public, investors, and the industry personnel.

Following this trend, law practitioners may soon realize new ways of smart contracting. By definition a “Smart Contract” [180] is a piece of software which reflects the logic of a legal contract in a sequence of if-then clauses. It continuously monitors if a certain event has happened and automatically executes predetermined actions; e.g., exchange of services [181], [182]. From a legal standpoint, it may be seen as a subject of mutual declaration of intent between at least two parties [183], where a party could be an organization, a person or machine. Nowadays, the construction industry struggles with a plethora of paperwork and bureaucracy with regard to contract formation and execution. Additionally, it takes inconveniently long time to purchase all needed materials. Smart contracts seem to be a very promising digital tool for reducing overhead costs and optimizing the process how business is done in this industry [184].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• GDPR from May 2018 will require companies to disclose all data related to customers or EU-citizens within a fixed time period.

Additionally, the scope, type, and size of contract disputes will decrease [186]. Due to the shared transaction history, smart contracts will increase trust through transparency and reliability [181]. This makes them very suitable for implementation of trust agreements and insurance policies [183]. Furthermore, marketplaces for smart contracts for SMEs could be developed in the future which will facilitate the adoption of intelligent contracting [184].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Christian Spier\">\\n<H2>Data Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Novel technologies and tightening data regulations pushes the industry towards data standardization</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry is perceived as one of the slowest moving industries regarding digitization efforts. However, institutions like the European Union are constantly working on tightening data privacy regulations and enabling data-driven business models, putting a lot of pressure on the construction industry, in particular. For instance, the onset of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25th, 2018 poses a challenge for many small and medium-sized businesses struggle when it comes to storing data digitally. Additionally, the implementation of collaborative and cloud-based technologies such as Building Information Modeling, Internet of Things or Augmented Reality are being tested via pilot projects by major players in the industry. Although such technologies promise faster execution, less planning and safety risks as well as increased collaboration, they also bring up new questions regarding intellectual property, data privacy, and security of data flows.

Nevertheless, construction faces an era of significant economic changes which fundamentally influence the development of trending technological or business model developments.\\nThe following section deals with recent economic trends in the German construction sector. We analyzed general macroeconomic indicators on a national level, such as stable interest as well as inflation rates, slightly increasing GDP growth and increasing industry investments driven by domestic demand. Based on that, we then identified six industry specific economic trends which shape the future of construction in Germany.\\nFirstly, we investigated drivers for ongoing growth in the German construction market. Although governmental spending continuously increased over the last years, new residential projects seem to be the driving force behind rising demand. Despite promising drivers like low unemployment rates, population growth or general customer confidence, our findings suggest growth rates in new residential projects to diminish within the following years. As a result, demand in renovation and modernization projects is likely to expand.\\nMoreover, we analyzed the labor market situation in the construction sector, which suffers from a considerable skill shortage. Certainly, the unattractive industry image is a major factor for scarcity in skill. Ageing demographics as well as increasing implementation of sophisticated technological innovations will even aggravate this situation. Continuous training of employees as well as higher salaries will therefore be critical for successful digitization and productivity development within the industry.\\nFurthermore, we researched the operating area, which the construction sector gets more and more international. On the one hand, as demand can hardly be met with current levels of workforce and productivity, German construction companies are collaborating with foreign subcontractors. On the other hand, highly specialized German construction firms are expanding activities beyond country borders. Resulting competition pressure might lower construction prices and increase the importance of international partnerships and networks.\\nAnother strategic response of construction companies on rising demand and productivity pressure is increased merger integration. We identified several tendencies towards local market consolidation through subcontractor integration and movements up the value chain. Increased M&amp;A activities suggest further growth of mid-sized companies and incremental industry margins.\\nThe market landscape, however, will change not only through vertical integration, but also through augmented market entries of innovative players. We found that the digitally underdeveloped sector offers a fertile soil for emerging ConTech start-ups. The number of new entrants as well as availability of suitable digital solutions increase along with the awareness of established companies for innovation importance. Besides forecasted productivity improvements, innovative market entries will result in fiercer market competition.\\nAdding up on that, we finally assessed the impact of expanded digital technology usage on lately stagnating productivity. Comparing the construction sector to other industries, productivity is estimated to increase up to 30%, contributed mainly by digital technologies [2]. An advanced level of digitization and resulting productivity increases in return will attract further investments and boost growth.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kai Siebenrock\">\\n<H2>Deceleration in New Residential Construction</H2>\\n<H3>New residential projects are the key driver but rates are declining</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn recent years, residential construction has been the growth engine for the industry and currently accounts for 61% of all construction investments [194]. The new building business was the major contributor, while renovation projects, which have a higher volume, contributed only marginally to the overall growth [195]. Even in the upcoming years, the residential construction volume is expected to increase due to overall economic strength in Germany, which is accompanied by low unemployment, consumer confidence, and increased disposable income [195]. Urbanization creates a significant housing deficit in urban areas and a need for new residential projects. Population growth due to domestic migration further fuels the demand for housing: the number of private households is expected to increase from 41.3m today to 43.2m in 2035 [196]. German policy makers support the positive development through funding programs like \"Baukindergeld\" and by setting a low interest base rate, thereby evoking attractive financing terms. However, research revealed that the growth dynamics could be slowed down. DIW expects an end of recent years’ boom and considerably declining growth rates [197]. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Housing projects accounted for 61% of all construction investments in Germany in 2015 [194]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Residential construction projects represent the driving force for growth in the construction industry since 2010 due to overall economic strength with an average year over year rate of 12% [197], [194]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Growth dynamic in new construction volume is expected to be reduced from +13% in 2017 to +8% in 2018, down to +4% in 2019 [197]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Number of construction permissions has been stagnant since mid 2016 [197]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In urban areas, purchase prices for housing have grown faster than rent, leading to reduced rate of return for investments [195]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Central banks have initiated an end of the ultra-low interest policies: ECB has announced to end further bond repurchases programs which will lead to a slight increase in interest rates for housing loans [197]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The growth of construction prices has increased more than inflation [196]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• End of boom in residential construction projects leads to reduced growth rates [197], [198]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Demand differs significantly across geographic regions [199]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Uncertainty in approval rates of construction projects in the future affected by potential new regulations [197]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The research shows a reduced growth outlook for new residential construction projects in the next five years. Instead, new political objectives in climate protection and energy efficiency restorations are anticipated to strengthen the dynamic in the renovation and modernization section. Companies operating in the residential construction section should prepare and consider engaging in the renovation business. Further, governmental construction projects are also expected to grow due to the improved financial situation of municipalities and the investment backlog of recent years. With this in mind, construction companies should evaluate to expand their business offerings to governmental construction.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kilian Egger\">\\n<H2>Skilled Labor Scarcity</H2>\\n<H3>Upcoming digitalization and demographic change further increase skill shortage</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry is currently suffering a considerable skill shortage [200]. While demand is steadily increasing and productivity is underlying sluggish growth, the number of construction-related apprenticeship graduates has even declined in Germany over the last decade [153]. An overall low unemployment rate of about 3% as well as the industry’s unattractive image to young workers aggravate the struggle for construction employers to close the skill-gap [201], [202]. As a result, sub-contractors are hired. Their unskilled staff and language barriers are partly responsible for delays, bricolage and low productivity in general [202].\\nTwo factors threaten to even intensify this skill shortage within the next years: ageing demographics and the implementation of digital solutions [203], [153], [204]. Firstly, the increasing proportion of elderly people in the population reduces the availability of workforce as more employees retire than young workers are entering the sector. Secondly, upcoming digitization and involving innovation pressure even increase the demand for skilled workers capable of adapting to evolving technologies [205]. Continuous training of staff and higher incentives for potential employees are therefore crucial factors for SMEs to cope with the skill shortage.\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Job vacancies for skilled workers in the German construction sector increased by 91% between 2009 and 2017 and it currently takes on average 160 days to fill a vacancy [200], [204].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Apprenticeships in European construction sector declined and also adult participation rate in education and training decreased from 9.4% in 2010 to 8.9% in 2016 [153].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Digitalization in the construction industry increases (e.g. governmental initiative “planen-bauen 4.0”) and technological change shifts skill demands predominantly towards high-level skills [205], [206], [207].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• German demand in the construction sector has grown over the last decade with annual revenue increases between 3% and 8% [200].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Working age population in Europe has decreased steadily and is projected to further decrease from 65% to 63% within the next five years [153], [203], [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Number of young skilled workers diminished due to comparably low wages, safety risks and unattractive working conditions [202].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Implementation of digital solutions in construction industry until 2020 raises demand of skilled workforce [203], [207].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing sophistication of technology demands new and broader skill sets at all levels of construction companies [203], [208].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Continuous training of staff is crucial for sustainable digitalization challenging especially SMEs and sub-contractors with comparably low investment capacity [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Construction industry struggles to overcome unattractive industry image and recruit digital talent [209], [208].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The lack of skilled workforce will have profound effects on the development of the construction industry within the next years. Salaries are expected to rise as stable revenues increase industry unattractiveness and low unemployment rates induce better negotiation power for employees [208]. Moreover, skilled labor scarcity decelerates the implementation of digital solutions because investments in new technologies might not seem profitable when critical human capital for digital application is missing. Small companies tend to face higher entry barriers and get forced to focus on certain niches as they might not have enough investment capabilities for crucial implementation of innovative technologies and employee trainings [210].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Till Wiechmann\">\\n<H2>Increased Cross-Border Activities</H2>\\n<H3>Large construction enterprises and highly specialized companies expand to other countries</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIncreasing government spending in Europe and the aforementioned trends of increasing need of residential real estate lead to an overall rising demand. Due to labor scarcity and only modest productivity improvements over the past decades, existing companies in the German construction industry can hardly accommodate the rising demand. As a result, cross-border activities increase in both directions: highly specialized construction companies from Germany expand their activities beyond country borders and foreign “conventional” companies enter the German construction market. The former highly local industry faces both increased labor movement but also an increase in cross-border projects.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Number of international deals in Europe increases [211], [212].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Even though margins in foreign countries are often lower, number of cross-border deals increases for large construction companies [213].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• International growth is mainly driven by largest and specialized companies [214].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Especially companies from EU countries with comparatively slow growth in their home market (Spain, Portugal etc.) begin to build capacities for construction abroad [215].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• After years of budget cuts after the financial crisis in 2008, government spending increase in multiple EU countries.

These new well-connected cross-border competitors are able to offer low prices and challenge existing “local” companies by increasing the price pressure. On the other hand, highly specialized German construction companies are also able to increase their foreign business activities-</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• To engage in cross-border activities, improved logistics are required since most of the small- and medium-sized construction companies operate within a radius of 50km [218]. For this reason, building up partner networks also becomes a crucial part of doing profitable business abroad.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Till Wiechmann\">\\n<H2>Local Market Consolidation</H2>\\n<H3>Increased subcontractor integration and movements up the value chain changes industry landscape</H3>\\n<Text>\\nWhile the German construction industry is still highly fragmented, first movements towards a more consolidated market can be observed [219]. After the market power of large construction companies such as Hochtief or Bilfinger began to diminish, mid-sized companies started to grow their business and are now expanding to take other positions along the value chain. This leads to more integration of subcontractors, which have always been very important to mid-sized companies. Their number and importance for the industry has increased multiple years in a row. Now, this has changed [220], [204], [221], [222]. More subcontractors are acquired by local medium-sized construction firms and are not fully compensated by new market entries, which leads to local consolidation of the market.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Current high demand leads to confidence in the industry. Number of insolvencies went down, but no increase in market entries can be observed [221_2], [224].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• More and more companies begin to integrate subcontractors down the value chain to increase profitability. Other companies also move up the value chain and engage as project planners [213].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Investments in the industry are mainly from Germany, no in- or decrease of foreign investments [220], [204].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• M&amp;A activity is still comparably low, but slightly increases. M&amp;A deals mainly come from construction firms integrating up- and down the value chain [213], [220].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• High demand and promising industry outlooks lead to most companies operating at their full capacity. Only way to increase earnings even further is to increase the own margin, e.g. by integrating along the value chain</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Mid-sized construction enterprises try to professionalize and optimize their businesses by controlling bigger parts of the construction process.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Strategic decisions are needed for mid-sized construction companies on what kind of integrations to focus. The options are either trying to strive for full vertical integration in a certain type of construction segment or to move towards a planning company which coordinates others and offers in-house building capacity for certain types of projects</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Payroll overhead risk increases when integrating subcontractors down the value chain.</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• When moving up the value chain organizational capacity building needs to be managed. Lack of skilled workforce increases due to changing demand for planning skills.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The integration of subcontractors leads to further growth of mid-sized companies and increased industry margins [225]. Fueled by this development, the complexity of operating a profitable construction business increased with more projects managed end-to-end by one company or by networks of partner companies. This leads to to adverse selection: good subcontractors are increasingly organized in partner networks or integrated in larger companies; “leftover” companies underperform and subcontractor quality decreases. The elimination of management layers as well as reduction of coordination effort allows growing businesses to increase the price pressure, which could force some smaller companies out of parts of the market.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kilian Egger\">\\n<H2>Innovative Market Entries</H2>\\n<H3>Favorable market conditions and innovation potential lure disruptive entrants</H3>\\n<Text>\\nMarket entries and investments in construction tech start-ups grow due to overall favorable economic conditions and digitization potential in the construction industry. Founders and investors have realized that construction lags in productivity compared to other industries and that the digitally underdeveloped sector could benefit substantially from new technologies. Contributing about 10% to the national GDP with increasing revenue forecasts and stable industry development, the European construction sector offers a promising platform for disruptive entrants [221_3].\\n \\nEven though start-ups still struggle with convincing old-established SMEs of their products and services, they are breaking through with mainly collaboration software, offsite construction solutions, project management tools as well as mobile and cloud integrations [227], ETT18]. More mature markets like the United States or Japan act as forerunners with role model companies like off-site constructor Katerra or project management software provider Procore [204], [201], [227]. As it has been the case in other industries, construction is expected to gain significant productivity increases through digital market entrants in Europe. The global manufacturing industry, for example, has seen a productivity rise by 34% on average over the past decade while productivity in ICT has grown by 24% through digital innovation [3], [206].\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Less than 6% of German construction companies make full use of digital planning tools [228].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Global construction start-up and venture capital activity has been steadily increasing between 2009 and 2018, with 478 closed deals and a funding amount of about 3.73bn € [227].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Networking events like the introduction of the “Tech in Construction” fair in Germany in 2018 evolve and bring start-ups and construction companies together [229].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Market entry and increased number of industry collaborations by start-ups offer project management and documentation software in Germany [230], [218].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Economic stability as well as favorable financial conditions and forecasts for the construction industry are expected [206], [201].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Huge potential to increase productivity by digital solutions within the construction industry should be made use of [204].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Development of technological possibilities suitable for the construction sector increases [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• R&amp;D expenses as well as innovation partnerships increase within the German construction industry [231], [232].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Construction companies need to open up for collaboration with start-ups and increase R&amp;D expenditures or partnerships to keep on track [228].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Risk of disinvestment in unsuitable or short-living digital solutions [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Entrants need to offer standardized and compatible applications due to high interdependencies between multiple stakeholders in the construction industry [153].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Work on construction sites is not ready for implementation of digital solutions (e.g. skill shortage) [153].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Innovative players entering the industry will substantially influence the German construction market. Productivity is generally expected to increase about 10% - 30%. This will allow to meet more of future demand and augment industry revenues [3], [227]. However, higher revenues will increase competition and new technology standards might challenge small construction companies to invest or get forced out of the market.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Lisa Neu\">\\n<H2>Productivity Improvement</H2>\\n<H3>Increased use of digital technologies drives productivity</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the past ten years, productivity in the German construction industry has increased by only 4.1%. In comparison, the productivity development of the entire German economy was 11% during this period [3]. One reason of this modest improvement could be the low utilization of digital technologies. Industries of the manufacturing sector, for instance, take more advantage of the opportunities through digitization than the construction industry and have increased their productivity by 34.1% on average [3].\\nThe use of digital tools and technologies allows the reduction of coordination activities, more efficient scheduling, greater flexibility, saving time and costs [206]. Even though new technologies are more readily available and improvements in the digitalization in the construction sector are expected to lead to higher productivity, construction companies only make little use of them [204]. As technology companies continue to enter the sector, construction firms that choose to be early adopters are likely to gain market share as a result of higher productivity [233], [2].\\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey, in 2016 only 44% of construction leaders reported that their organizations had adopted some type of digital technology; however, there is a visible trend: 70% of the respondents plan to implement digital technologies within the next three years [233]. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Improvements in the digitalization in the construction sector are expected to lead to higher productivity [204].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Potential global productivity improvement from implementation of best practices is estimated to be 14-15% through the use of digital technologies whereas cost savings are assessed to be 4-6% [233].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• For instance, the use of integrated planning tools on a large-scale oil and gas project achieved a 70% increase in the project’s productivity [233].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasingly complex projects and rising demand in terms of volume, cost, and quality require the construction industry to improve its productivity [233].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Many construction projects suffer from overruns in cost and time due to unexpected cost increases, planning errors and insufficiently calculated risks [233].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• BIM will be introduced by 2020 as the new standard for transport infrastructure projects and forces companies to participate in the digitization process [204].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• New technologies are readily available and innovative start-ups push digital solutions into the market [233].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• A minimum of digitization of the companies involved in the project is required [206]. Most of the information required to apply digital technologies along the value chain does not exist in a digitized way yet [218].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Many companies lack the necessary know-how and skills to use new technologies and systems [206].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Especially small companies shy away from the relatively high upfront investment costs for the implementation of the software and the training of the workers [206].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The use of digital technologies allows designing leaner processes, better handling of workforce reduction, optimized planning accuracy, time, greater flexibility and resource savings like time and costs [206], [233]. For this reason, and since BIM will be introduced as the standard in 2020 in Germany, a lack of BIM know-how (or other leading technologies) could become a significant competitive disadvantage in the near future [3]. As a result of productivity improvements, construction investments are expected to increase. An advanced level of digitization and productivity will make the construction industry more attractive to investors thanks to cost and time savings, better planning and increasing profitability [206].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n</Trends>\\n</Trends-Sub-Section>\\n<Trends-Sub-Section title=\"Business Model Trends\">\\n<H1>Business Model Trends</H1>\\n<Text responsible=\"Jingchen Wang\">A business model has two basic components: the company’s plans to generate sales revenue and the needed operational factors to reach and maintain profitability. The business models in the construction industry have not changed much in the last few years. The industry has remained resistant to digitalization [9], even as digitalization has revolutionized almost every other industry. As a result of the industry’s conservative nature, the productivity remained low [234]. Today, the industry faces a myriad of changes caused by various social, economic and technological factors. These changes require the industry to reexamine its business models and present an opportunity to adopt digital practices.\\n\\nCurrently, the industry is very fragmented, with small and medium companies choosing to focus on just one stage while bigger companies focusing on multiple stages of the value chain. One way companies can make use of this fragmentation is by evolving their business models to collaborate with one another on different stages of the value chain. Digital technologies enable platforms and project management tools, which could provide means of enhanced communication and cooperation, not just among construction companies but also with customers and suppliers.These solutions could potentially make it easier to cooperate even on large projects and to help increase the efficiency of the whole construction process. \\nCollaboration can be extended to resource as well. To find additional resources for peaks in the production or to boost capacity utilization many new digital platforms are emerging. They try to match the supply and demand to the mutual satisfaction of the involved parties. Flexible resources play a major role in this context and those resources are not limited to hardware. Another factor that affects construction business models is how projects are calculated and planned. In the past, many negotiations for construction projects only had the goal of minimizing costs in the construction phase [235]. However, many decisions made in the initial planning phase have heavily influence the asset’s operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Costs can also be reduced by building more efficiently, in this regard many construction companies try to use prefabricated elements, which were produced off-site in advance. Because of this approach mass customization like in the automotive industry can be implemented in the construction industry too. \\nThese are just some of the most profound trends impacting the business models in the construction industry. All of these trends force small, medium and large companies in the construction industry to rethink and adapt their business models as well as their position in the value chain.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Eileen Einwächter\">\\n<H2>Prefabrication</H2>\\n<H3>Shifting from on-site to off-site construction enables more efficient and scalable processes</H3>\\n<Text>\\nPrefabrication is the practice of producing construction components under factory conditions at off-site locations and manufacturing plants. The components can be either standardized or customized and range from individual components to complete structures. They can be applied to various project types, be it small residential houses or large-scale industrial plants. These structures are then transported to the construction site and eventually assembled to construct buildings [236], [237], [238]. Other terms that have been frequently used to describe prefabrication are preassembly, modularization, system building, and industrialized building [239], [240].\\nConstruction companies around the world have been widely using prefabrication for many years, but current industry trends like the increasing use of BIM and lean construction are renewing the industries view on this practice [239], [238]. US startups like Katerra and FullStack Modular, which use prefabrication and modularization, are on the rise [241]. But also, German companies like Max Bögl are refocusing on modular prefabrication in order to tackle challenges like increasing time pressure under high demand in the industry [242]. The benefits associated with prefabrication include: faster on-site assembly, more controlled production environment independent from weather conditions, reduced waste generation, and safer working conditions [9], [243], [237].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The market share of prefabricated building in Germany has had an average growth of approx. 2.7% per year since 2005 [2], [244], [245], while the market share for prefabricated one- and two-family houses reached 19,3% in 2017 [244].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Off-site construction companies like Katerra and Blu Homes are redefining and reviving prefabrication in the US [241]. In 2017, Alphabet ordered 300 apartment units for around $30 million from FactoryOS, a modular housing startup based in California, in order to provide housing for employees [246].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The Japanese retailer Muji has launched a series of small prefabricated houses called the ‘MUJI Hut’ in 2017 [247].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The increased adoption of emerging technologies like BIM and 3D-printing enable a more efficient use of prefabrication and OSM practices [248], [249].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In the face of housing shortages and the need for fast construction of affordable buildings, the German government has identified modular construction as a possible solution in their coalition agreement and uttered its support [228], [250].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Labor shortages force companies to attract workers by offering more pleasing working conditions off-site [251].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Design flexibility is reduced and limited to possible module configurations and combinations, while users demand individual solutions [9], [252].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• High initial set-up costs as well as increased transportation costs, which depend on the distance from the factory to the construction site, arise [9], [248].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to past experiences with prefabricated buildings around the 1960s, poor image and quality misconceptions of prefabricated buildings still remain [9], [248], [253].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The handling of large prefabricated components poses a problem in space-constrained construction sites [9], [251].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Prefabrication not only experiences renewed attention from startups entering the market, but also offers potential benefits for diversified medium-sized businesses [2]. The impact on the business model depends highly on the level of modularization, addressed end-user segments, dependency on additional resources, and individual positioning in the building process [252]. Conceivable business models range from component suppliers to providers of turnkey solutions [252]. As initial investments are high, the transition towards prefabrication is more viable for medium and large-scale companies which possibly already own a manufacturing site [251].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Marc Klingen\">\\n<H2>Whole Life Cycle Perspective</H2>\\n<H3>Plan/build for the whole life cycle instead of only for construction</H3>\\n<Text>\\nLife cycle costing (LCC) describes the process of considering and modeling the present value of all costs along the life cycle of a project, when comparing different alternatives in the design and planning phase [235], [254]. In the past in the construction industry, owners negotiated and contracted construction projects based on minimizing costs solely in the construction phase [235]. However, decisions made in the initial planning phase heavily influence an asset’s operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs and end of life costs [255]. Often, front-loaded inexpensive changes have a significant impact after the construction phase is finished [9], [235]. Thus, LCC is a means to reduce the total costs of an asset by smart and iterative planning.\\r\\nIn other industries, e.g. manufacturing and IT procurement, LCC and total cost of ownership calculations are standard methodologies [256]. In construction, only large asset managers frequently adopt LCC, as they directly benefit from decreased life cycle costs. For projects outside of the portfolio of these asset managers, owners rather focus on minimizing initial costs as they do not plan ahead [235]. LCC is already standardized in some aspects by International Organization for Standardization (ISO), but is not used as iteratively as with BIM [255].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The present value of O&amp;M and end of life costs of a typical construction project account for 40-80% of the life cycle costs [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• When the use of an construction asset changes, reconfiguration costs are high and heavily impact life cycle costs. Thus, achieving adaptability of an asset is key to reduce life cycle costs [255].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In Germany, the economics of public projects need to be calculated. However, no iterative LCC is required but the maximum construction costs for the project to be economic are estimated by taking into account the life cycle costs [257].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• BIM adoption increases and sets the basis for collaborative LCC calculations as the cost trade-offs can be modeled transparently and efficiently. This applies especially for projects not owned by asset managers who perform LCC already [258], [18].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Construction companies are increasingly commoditized which drives competition. LCC is a way to differentiate positively from competition [259].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Environmental regulations changed the mindset of owners to a life cycle view already, as environmental aspects need to be considered holistically [260], [213].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Incentives of developer, constructor and asset owner are not aligned as they have different preferences for construction and subsequent life-cycle costs [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Stakeholders of construction and O&amp;M phase rarely collaborate and information is mostly shared paper-based [261], [18]. The building performance is uncommonly assessed along the life cycle and especially in O&amp;M [262].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• LCC calculations are hardly neutral, unbiased and comparable given the impact that different interest rate, inflation rate and life span expectations have. However, these can be easily adjusted [255], [9].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• LCC completely changes the mindset and customer interactions of construction companies. Without LCC, they have very different incentives compared to the owner as they aim to minimize cost and quality within the set specifications. With LCC, construction companies are able to sell quality and good planning and differentiate from competition without engaging in a price war. Especially measures that prolong a project’s life expectancy have a huge impact.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kai Riemenschneider\">\\n<H2>Value Chain Reconfiguration</H2>\\n<H3>Companies rethink their positioning on the value chain</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the coming years one of the crucial questions for individual construction firms as well as the industry as a whole would be which stage of the traditional value chain to cover and which not . The construction industry, especially in Germany, is characterized by a fragmented market, low margins, fierce competition and high pressure on prices [36]. Currently generalized companies covering most of the value chain in various segments exist just as well as specialized ones that focus on one specific segment or step of the value chain. However, several major players like Bilfinger attempt to extend their coverage of the value chain, while decreasing own construction activities [263]. Similar trends can be observed outside Germany; completely vertically integrated construction startup Katerra for example has just recently received almost 1bn $ of funding [264]. As SMEs adopt to these changes, previous separate steps of the value chain are merged, while opportunities for further specialization in specific parts of the value chain arise.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Due to the complexity of construction projects and extensive subcontracting practices an enormous number of companies is involved in the building process, the €8bn infrastructure project “Stuttgart 21” for example has over 60 companies involved [265].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Subcontractors account on average for over 30% of the costs for a construction project and, like suppliers, have a huge market power [266].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Katerra (startup) and Fluor (incumbent) are examples that outperform other construction companies after successful vertical integration [264], [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Major players in the German construction industry like Hochtief and Bilfinger have acquired several companies during the last years which extended their value chain coverage [2].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• An increasing lack of subcontractors forces construction companies to perform tasks on their own [36].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Industry 4.0 concepts as digitization and automation technologies drive vertical integration as the management of complex processes gets easier [267].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Emerging digital platforms assume tasks of traditional construction companies and force them to specialize [268 Business Model Trends: Emerging Digital Platforms].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Varied and sophisticated customer requirements open up opportunities for specialized niche firms [263].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Vertical integration is difficult to implement successfully and costly to reverse in case of failure [269].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Previous competitive advantages (e.g. cost leadership in building) might hamper good performance in other integrated areas (e.g. R&amp;D) [270].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Bureaucratic costs arise in the course of vertical integration, which need to be counted against the possible efficiency gains [271].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• As companies change their coverage of the value chain, no matter integrating or specializing, their current corporate culture will not be as effective anymore [272].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• While highly specialized construction companies had the highest growth rates and highest EBIT in the past years, several industry trends like digitization and resource scarcity will most likely favor especially highly vertically integrated, big and generalized companies [2], [36].

These digital solutions for the construction industry include not only e-commerce platforms for materials and finished products but also apps and project management tools with a construction focus [241_2]. This segment is where the digitalization is currently taking place.\\nPlatform companies like Alibaba and Amazon are already the world’s most valuable companies by market capitalization [274]. Digital economy will account for 25% of the world\\'s entire economy by 2020 and platform business models represent an ever increasing proportion of this overall total [275].

The trend of an increase in cross company collaboration is a solution to overcome a future where this scattered landscape will stay the same, or even increase. Resulting in the necessity that all of those participants have to collaborate, to form an interplay along the construction value chain and throughout a complete project life cycle [9], [284]. Many of them have to collaborate with each other and become part of shared agreements in order to coordinate the construction of complex projects and products in uncertain and competitive environments [285]. Since the labor resources have been exhausted to the greatest possible extent in Germany, many companies are forced to collaborate with more domestic and foreign subcontractors to find the necessary resources [286], [194].\\nBut even in the face of the ongoing digitization, the construction industry has been very hesitant in implementing the latest software and new processes focusing on collaboration and project management [9]. \\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The amount of subcontractors has risen in the last years [194].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The business relations between a general contractor and his subcontractors are stable and continuous over long time periods, and only rarely established through competitive bidding [287].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Partnerships and joint ventures are a common practise to share risks in the industry [288].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Because of access to innovation and technology, response to market, resource efficiency and client requirements, contractors are very positive about collaboration for projects [289].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Collaboration with multiple domestic and foreign (sub-) subcontractors is becoming a common practice in the construction industry [194].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• BIM is an easy way of collaborating and sharing information between stakeholders [9].

Unused resources and demand are being matched through the internet to mutual satisfaction of the parties involved. Many examples of business model rise every day around the world from the AirBnB to Uber. This trend is clearly not limited to B2C markets, it also starts to penetrate industrial B2B markets. As for construction industry, it first started in the U.S. with online marketplaces like Getable offering to share contractor\\'s idle equipments with other contractors. This initial idea led, by extension, any type of fleet owner company - whether a contractor, a rental company, or even a manufacturer - the ability to consider sharing underutilized equipment online [291].  \\nThe same goes for labor, where hiring halls are replaced by software platforms (e.g. WORKNOW presented by Colorado Resource Partners), which offer standardised pay at a fair wage, supply workers with skills appropriate to the project and create an automated system for finding instant jobs.\\nRegarding construction materials, companies can benefit from E-commerce in different ways [292]. Various webstores such as XFACTORY and GoFor offer not only a much larger pool of construction materials to harness, but also on-demand delivery service which saves time and money. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded a 4.8% rise in material cost over the past year. In an uncertain market, contractors and suppliers alike are concerned about the rising cost of building materials [293], [294].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Unscheduled downtime is a big concern for productivity and is mainly caused due to the breakdown of equipments, which are often very expensive to keep as a backup in standby all time [295].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Successful Sharing Economy business models in B2B markets: \"Supplies and raw materials\" (e.g. GreenTrade.net [296]), \"Hospitality and office space\" (e.g. PivotDesk.com [297]), and \"Equipment, inventory and logistics\" ( e.g. Cohealo.com [297]).</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The risk of unused capital and consequential low rates of return on that equipment [298]. The inverse relationship between the availability of construction jobs and the availability of a skilled workforce [299]. Timely Delivery ensures compliance with flexible schedules.

Higher level of transparency [298].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Due to the high cyclicality and volatility of construction business [9], demands of different companies may positively correlate with one another and hence result in short supply. Additional unknowns emerge. e.g.  What will happen to wage and rental rate variability? Will the impact on utilisation of capital truly be improved and by how much? [298] Hard to ensure that equipment is being properly inspected and maintained [291]. Potential high labor turnover makes it difficult for companies to keep the knowledge in-house.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• E-commerce and sharing economy greatly increase the availability of construction equipment, labor and material, allow for fleet optimization and provide delivery certainty [291]. Thus they are among the strongest drivers of productivity gains in the construction industry. This will also result in a reduced upfront investment by transforming capital expense to operating expense. Small and medium sized construction companies are supposed to be the largest beneficiary: a greater process-level flexibility is achieved with a much lower initial investment being required.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n</Trends>\\n</Trends-Sub-Section>\\n</Trends-Sub-Sections>\\n</Trends-Section>\\n<Ideas><Idea><Title><H1>Conas</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>A Virtual Audio Assistant for On-Site Efficiency</H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>Conas is a cloud-based audio assistance designed for on-site construction workers. With Conas, they are supported in extracting information from complex construction plans and hence, in delivering their assigned tasks efficiently and according to requirements. Construction plans are usually developed as 3D models in architectural software and &#8211; in a steadily increasing number of cases &#8211; implemented in BIM. However, on construction sites, workers still rely on 2D paper-based plans as a source of measurements, material information, and interior object location. Conas provides a digitized solution in translating the information of a construction plan into audio. \\nFrom a technical perspective, this solution is enabled by the Conas design-to-speech software. Architects and construction companies upload their BIM and CAD design files to the Conas cloud, which translates every detail of the plans into natural language. The audio of this text is accessible via a smartphone application. Similar to speech assistants, such as Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, construction workers can ask Conas for information about the plan such as measures and materials. Additionally, construction workers can leave comments, e.g. in case of flaw detection. To play the audio and to enable smooth operation, Conas offers noise-canceling earphones and microphone as an optional product bundle. However, the app can connect to any Bluetooth-compatible headphones. \\nThe design of the Conas assistant allows for several functionalities: On the one hand, construction workers can receive information from construction plans while using their hands for the current task. Workers can ask for specific measures or materials without consulting the plan visually or having to recall mental notes. On the other hand, several application programming interfaces (APIs) enable additional services. To overcome language barriers on construction sites, we offer the audio pieces in multiple languages. In addition, text-to-speech services allow construction workers to communicate with the app for the sake of documentation. \\nThe target groups are construction companies of all sizes as well as subcontractors on-site, who are supported during the onboarding process and subsequent project phases. Customers sign up for the service via a monthly subscription for each account. Thus, Conas offers its service to a wide range of firms contributing to the construction process.\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Easy access to information from construction plans</Item><Item>Higher accuracy through controlled information flow</Item><Item>Greater safety during the workflow</Item><Item>Removal of language barriers</Item><Item>Documented errors</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Constructions plans are becoming more complex due to regulations and customer requirements. For example, with the increase of smart homes, unfamiliar requirements arise for the worker. Adhering to these requirements means that the workers must be able to extract the correct information from constructions plans. Conas allows users to obtain any information from the construction plan without having to lay aside construction tools, take off gloves or unfold the plan itself. As Conas is based on audio, the user can continue working with his hands while receiving information.\\nConas provides any detail required at any point in time during the workflow. This controlled flow of information makes it easier for the workers to understand the construction plan as they are no longer overwhelmed with a lot of information from the paper plan. Conas can help any user of a traditional paper plan, from a driller making holes to a worker installing windows.\\nThe product also allows the worker to make comments or observations while working. These comments are saved and also available to the supervisor who can then decide how to act on them. This feature allows for a smooth flow of information between workers and supervisors. Moreover, Conas can overcome language barriers which exist on construction sites as construction companies usually employ people from all over the world. As the software supports over 30 different languages, it can translate all information accordingly. Therefore, less time needs to be spent to instruct international employees on plans.  \\nConas, therefore, provides several benefits: First, the user can execute his task with greater accuracy by receiving precise information from the plans. Second, safety is increased because the user can use both hands for the workflow. Third, by leaving comments, the construction process is better documented. Finally, Conas saves time for the construction worker and hence, increases his productivity. \\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Setup support and training via learning videos</Item><Item>Key account management</Item><Item>Customer support via app or telephone</Item><Item>Product review via the app</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>Cultivating an appropriate B2B strategy is key to Conas&#8217; success. Continuous service and technical assistance enable a smooth onboarding process. Moreover, different business customers require different kinds of customer relationships, yet they face common challenges for product usage. \\nOnboarding: Customer onboarding requires the download of the app and the subsequent connection to the earphones. The app comes with learning videos guiding through the first steps, e.g. the upload of the construction plan. The respective file format needs to be provided by the architect, either via CAD or BIM. For firms that are technically not experienced, Conas offers an implementation service. It includes contacting the architect of the respective project and the upload of the data for the customer. To build strong relationships with lead customers, key accounts are set up, and personal assistance is provided during the first phase of the respective project. For example, on-site training for construction workers is provided. \\nProject support: Throughout projects, the combination of software, hardware, and interaction with the customer can lead to technical problems. In this case, the app provides a catalog on frequently emerging questions and challenges. If the worker cannot solve the problem himself, support service is available and reachable through the app. In emergency cases, Conas provides on-site support. This service is available to lead customers only. For feedback and product reviews, the Conas app itself provides an elaborate evaluation tool to directly capture the opinions of construction workers and improve the service afterward. \\n</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Direct mailing and company visits Construction fairs and trade journals Through project owners and project developers App stores and online sale of hardware Construction workers</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>The usage of digital products in the construction industry is currently quite rare. Therefore, Conas will utilize various channels to access the market. First, the initial focus will be to reach out to the customer directly. However, as a second strategy, project owners and developers are interesting distribution partners due to their extensive network of architects and construction firms. \\nDirect channels: Conas markets its product on a B2B basis. The challenge is to convince the representatives of construction firms that are possibly not involved in on-site work. To acquire these firms as customers and to get the product&#8217;s value proposition across, a direct approach is chosen. Conas&#8217; direct sales strategy includes direct mailing and company visits. Besides, to present the product to a larger audience, traditional media, and press, such as trade journals, help to create first touchpoints. Also, construction fairs offer great opportunities for potential customers to test the product. \\nIndirect channels: The second way to approach customers is via project owners or project development firms. These firms are the main actors for the tendering process and influence the processes on a construction site significantly. Another indirect channel is the construction workers, who have the interest to use Conas as it makes their work easier.\\nThe Conas application is available at all major app stores and provides a demo for testing the functionalities. The optional add-on hardware can be ordered online and is delivered via mail and package service. \\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Human Capital</Item><Item>Design-to-speech software and data</Item><Item>Additional software interfaces</Item><Item>Hardware</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>Human capital: Being a software company, skilled architects, designers, and software developers are key to Conas&#8217; success. In addition to this, experts in the application domain and their knowledge from the industry is important to create a product of high utility for critical construction situations. As Conas relies on many business partners and close customer relationships, employees with strong networking skills are required. \\nDesign-to-speech software and data: The value to the customer is brought by the design-to-speech software which is developed in-house. Our algorithms ensure that it recognizes various CAD and BIM models accurately. The cloud will collect a massive amount of data on construction plans and input from construction workers. This data is crucial to develop custom-fit solutions further. \\nAdditional software interfaces: The design-to-speech software is enriched with additional services of external providers. Therefore, the business partners providing APIs are key resources of Conas. For example, translation services address language barriers within the industry. Also, speech-to-text and text conversion services enable the communication between the worker and the software in the first place. By leaving comments, a worker can call attention to differences between plan and reality or other important notes. The status of an assigned task is documented and can be supervised. \\nHardware: The hardware interface between the software and the construction worker consists of high-quality earphones equipped with a microphone. Offering a compatible physical component accounting for the special environment of a construction site creates more value for the customers of Conas. The product needs to be designed robustly and with a noise-cancellation feature. \\n</text></Key-Resources-Text><Key-Activities-Canvas><Item>Key Activities</Item><Item>Development and maintenance of design-to-speech software and interfaces</Item><Item>Acquisition of software service providers and development of APIs</Item><Item>Customer acquisition and development of relationships</Item></Key-Activities-Canvas><Key-Activities-Text><Text>Conas assists construction workers with design-to-speech services available via earphones. To establish these functionalities, Conas focuses on four key activities: &#13;\\nDevelopment and maintenance of design-to-speech software and interfaces: The design-to-speech service is Conas&#8217; core feature. Hence, the development is concerned with the translation of CAD and BIM models into audio easily understandable by humans. First, it involves establishing access to all relevant data formats for training and testing. Second, putting this information into speech requires the system to understand the semantics of the CAD/BIM model as well as the semantics of documentation and comments given to certain objects. As a third step, the generated text needs to be transformed into speech by a third-party service provider. The front-end realization of Conas includes a smartphone application for construction workers and the cloud to upload models and plans which contain all data that is accessible via the speech assistant. &#13;\\nAcquisition of software service providers and development of APIs: In addition to creating the Conas software, APIs to external service providers need to be set up. Therefore, an essential part of the business model is the acquisition of reliable partners offering their service for the users of Conas. APIs for BIM and CAD software is necessary to read out plans for information such as measures, materials, and locations. Additionally, APIs for services such as language translation, speech-to-text, and text conversion is required.&#13;\\nCustomer acquisition and development of relationships: Entering a broad market with a new product pose challenges for communicating its value proposition to the customer. Therefore, acquiring relevant customers and ensuring their loyalty is decisive for market entry and long-term success. This starts with the development phase by involving construction firms throughout the realization of the product. Marketing and sales efforts are prominent activities, especially during the product launch phase. In the long run, those efforts not only need to be maintained but also improved. &#13;\\n</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>One-time setup fee for translation of construction plan to speech Subscription model depending on the number of accounts Hardware components Individual contracts</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>Conas&#8217; revenues are generated from both one-time setup revenue per project and recurring revenues per customer. To offer the product to a wide range of different construction firms, Conas combines a subscription model with a one-time fee for the first setup. &#13;\\nSetup fee: Construction companies pay an initial setup fee dependent on the complexity and size of the underlying construction project. This fee covers the operational assistance. &#13;\\nSubscription model: Conas&#8217; primary revenue streams are subscription fees to get access to the design-to-speech service via a mobile application. This fee depends on the number of accounts required, which reflects the number of construction workers on-site. The payment system is based on a monthly subscription fee to account for short-term projects. This way, entry barriers are kept low for new customers of different sizes. For example, this pricing model allows for flexibility during seasons of less construction activity.  &#13;\\nHardware component: An additional revenue stream is created by the sale of the hardware component. Earphones equipped with a microphone and noise-canceling feature are bought in bulk and sold to the customer. As the hardware is highly compatible with the software product and features noise cancellation, it improves the performance of Conas significantly in the noisy and vibrating environment on construction sites. Customers are charged once for the component. To attract more customers during the time of market entry, the hardware is also available on a rental basis. &#13;\\nIndividual contracts: In case of high usage volume or long-term projects, contracts are negotiated on an individual basis. This procedure comes along with benefits for the customer including discounts, free hardware, or even a tailored solution. For Conas, these lead customers strengthen Conas&#8217; financial position and possibly provide valuable knowledge for the product&#8217;s further development. </Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Software and API providers Architects and construction firms Project owners and project developers Hardware supplier</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Putting Conas into practice, there are two groups of key partners required. The first group includes partnerships that help to develop the technology and to offer additional hardware. Of similar importance, however, are partners with expert knowledge that share their experience and test the prototype. This second group includes, for example, project developers and architects, that can also create touchpoints with the intended customer segments. &#13;\\nSoftware and API providers:  The service delivered by Conas is supported and complemented by external service providers. These partners are crucial to realizing major and minor features such as reading BIM and CAD data files, translating languages and speech-to-text processing. Using the services provided by these partners allows Conas to focus on its core activities and enter the market more quickly without sacrificing any quality requirements of the product. &#13;\\nArchitects and construction firms: To develop and validate the design-to-speech service, industry knowledge is required. Experienced architects in CAD and BIM modeling and data from existing models can provide valuable insight into early-stage software development. The strong connection to the industry enables Conas to create a product that meets the customer&#8217;s needs and guarantees a high-quality standard. &#13;\\nProject owners and project developers: These partners accompany a construction project from the beginning to the very end. Hence, they not only possess valuable knowledge about the industry but also maintain a network of potential customers. Winning project owners and project developers as partners is a promising distribution channel, not least because of their influence in setting standards on the construction site. &#13;\\nHardware supplier: Conas focuses on a high-quality software product. However, its performance and user experience are strongly dependent on hardware quality. Therefore, the right partner who can deliver the required quality for the production of earphones and microphones is key. A strong partnership with its hardware provider will allow Conas to influence some of the design and functionality decisions of the manufacturer as well as receive favorable prices. This enables Conas to offer superior hardware at a highly competitive price.&#13;\\n</Text></Key-Partners-Text><Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Item>General contractors Subcontractors and specialists Construction workers</Item></Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Customer-Segmentation-Text><Text>The Conas software and hardware solution is a product that serves a B2B market and is primarily designed for employed construction workers as the end users. Customers participate in construction projects with complex plans and execute tasks including measurements, material, and positioning. Conas can support the entire workflow of the whole construction process from excavation to electricity and sanitary works. Hence, the product serves a broad share of the construction market. Conas&#8217; customers can be grouped into three sections: &#13;\\nGeneral contractors: General contractors normally offer all construction works from excavation to the turnkey handover and are targeted for two reasons: first, these firms are concerned with a wide range of construction tasks and can use Conas to assist their workers in performing this variety of tasks. Second, subcontracting is a usual practice in this industry. However, the general contractor is still responsible for the project and is tasked with coordination and process monitoring. Thus, the firms can advise or require their subcontractors to use Conas for faster processes and documentation during construction. This way, Conas realizes multiplier effects. &#13;\\nSubcontractors and specialists: The other customer segment consists of smaller companies which are often more specialized and employ fewer workers. Two implications arise for these companies: first, workers do not execute standard tasks and often require special instructions. Second, if only a few workers of a company work on-site, it brings about greater responsibility for the individual. If supervisors or other co-working partners are not available, the worker can make use of the on-site assistance by Conas to fulfill their tasks flawlessly.&#13;\\nConstruction workers: Construction workers are indirect customers. Their employers pay for the system, but the workers are the people benefiting directly from it. Conas avoids extra work for the construction workers as they don&#8217;t need to search for the supervisors or the paper plan in case of a problem. Instead, Conas supports them in real-time giving them ad-hoc feedback during the whole construction process. &#13;\\n</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Initial Investments Software development CAD / BIM consultation Acquisition of business partners Legal advice Variable Costs Sales and marketing Customer support Fixed Costs R&amp;D Investment IT infrastructure Office space and further work equipment Capital costs</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>To market Conas, three main types of costs arise. While initial investments refer to costs that come along with the development of the product, operational and recurring costs can be split into fixed and variable costs. \\nInitial investments: As with many software products, the initial development of the software requires high upfront investment. To create a viable product, qualified technicians and software developers are required. Further, specialists for CAD and BIM plans consult the technical implementation in how information should be derived from construction plans. The algorithm must be trained to reliably interpret and convert the data into audio information. Furthermore, the acquisition of business partners such as the supplier for earphones is a prerequisite for a hardware offering. Additionally, the use of third-party APIs and software development kits (SDKs) in the software reading out CAD and BIM files, as well as location and translation services, is also a key cost driver. Conas also requires legal advice to clarify possible liabilities. \\nVariable costs: Due to the nature of a B2B market and a large target group, an extensive sales and marketing team including key account management is essential. Marketing experts are tasked to build awareness and create a brand image by developing strategies for the product&#8217;s public presentation, e.g. at construction fairs. For implementation and further customer requests, Conas maintains a call center which incurs further costs. \\nFixed costs: State-of-the-art software products require continuous improvement and technical innovations in. Therefore, a fixed cost segment includes the maintenance of the software product and R&amp;D investments. The main asset of Conas is a high-quality product that enables fast data transfer without interruption. Thus, an appropriate IT infrastructure and user-friendly interface is key to long-term customer satisfaction. In general, a sufficient operational infrastructure includes office space and further work equipment. Lastly, capital costs are not negligible due to high upfront investments. \\n</Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry: In a fully-customized world, construction projects are highly individual which results in time-consuming tasks on-site. A highly fragmented market consists of many small companies. Combining both worlds makes it very likely that companies tend to specialize due to the small number of employees and individual requests from customers. Conas provides the highest value in this scenario due to the following reasons: Individual requests by customers result in many unique tasks for construction workers and almost no standards exist. Hence, audio assistance is extremely valuable for construction workers since every plan is entirely different. On top of that, construction companies are striving to gain market power which requires a larger number of employees. Additional support for workers such as Conas can differentiate a company from its competitors when it comes to recruiting. \\n</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: Exchanging the fragmented market with a consolidated market results in a smaller number of construction companies with a larger size each (up to a monopolist that employs every worker). Hence, the need for companies to differentiate themselves from others decreases. Since customization remains on a high level though, Conas is still a good fit for the market. To increase the attractiveness of Conas in this scenario, coordination of workers could add value for customers. For instance, a conversation with Conas about a measure in a specific room indicates that this worker executed a task in this room. In this way, the construction company can have a better overview of how the workers are allocated on the construction site and which tasks they currently face.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winner builds it all: As opposed to a fully customized world, a fully-standardized world results in very similar construction projects and tasks. Hence, more standards are established and known to construction workers. This decreases the value of Conas to a medium market fit. Nevertheless, this scenario is still a medium fit due to possible adjustments such as the coordination of employees. As standardization increases the usability of automated machines and robots on the construction site, the design-to-speech technology can be adapted to translate digital plans such that machines understand them properly. New building techniques like this can create an advantage over competitors which increases the market share of one player in the market.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: In a fully fragmented and standardized world, companies need to differentiate themselves more than ever from competitors. In comparison to the &#8216;Butler Industry&#8217; scenario, companies tend to specialize less, since more standardization is demanded on the market. Hence, products like Conas can increase the attractiveness of a company on the job market, which is a general goal of all construction companies in this scenario. Just as in the &#8216;Winner builds it all&#8217; scenario, the understanding of plan details like measures and materials can increase the usability of automated machines and robots. Since competition in the construction market is higher in a fragmented scenario, the use of robots can be a critical factor when it comes to gaining market power. Hence, we can increase the value of Conas by additionally offering a translation feature &#8216;design-to-machine&#8217; which is similar to &#8216;design-to-speech.&#8217;\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Craidar</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Enabling Connectivity and Progress Tracking on the Construction Site\\n</H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>In the past 50 years, many industries have seen incredible increases in productivity and efficiency. These industries have especially profited from the automation of processes, enabled through embracing new technologies. Contrarily, the construction industry has not seen much innovation in the recent past. As a result, it is one of the few industries that has not improved its processes significantly. The construction industry shows immense potential for increases in efficiency through the use of new technologies, especially the adaptation of connected IoT-devices. However, most useful applications realizing this potential require a specific form of internet connection, which is in most cases not sufficiently available on construction sites at the moment.&#13;\\nCraidar helps to solve this issue for large and medium-sized construction sites by providing two modules: a Wifi-Module delivering a reliable and fast internet connection to construction sites and a LIDAR-Module enabling the tracking of the construction of the building shell. If a crane is available on the construction site, the Wifi-Module will be mounted on top of the crane. As soon as there is no crane available anymore, the module should be attached to a central and relatively high point on the construction site. Depending on the location and possibilities for providing data in the particular area of the construction site, there are three ways to supply the module: Landline, cellular networks, and satellites. For an optimal connection, especially on large construction sites, the Wifi-Module can be reinforced through amplifiers. These allow the use of IoT-devices, as well as increased automation on construction sites. &#13;\\nThe LIDAR-Module will be installed in the crane boom on the trolley, with which it will move along. After the disassembly of the crane, the LIDAR-sensor provides no additional benefit, since the shell of the building is finished and most changes are now done inside the building. LIDAR-sensors and cameras in the module generate a point-cloud and a 3D-model of the construction site. Craidar will provide an API for manufacturers of BIM- and project-management-software so that the models can be used for automated comparisons of the BIM model with the constructed building shell, as well as automated tracking of the adherence to the planned building process. Also, detection of workers and building material could be improved when utilizing automated crane steering, leveraging the data generated by the sensors.&#13;\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Wifi: Ensuring connectivity on the construction site and large data packages for multiple IoT-devices</Item><Item>Laying the groundwork for an exponential increase of IoT-devices on construction sites</Item><Item>Efficiency gains and cost savings by enabling usage of connectivity-based services</Item><Item>LIDAR: Accurate assessment of building progress</Item><Item>Transparency about the status quo of the building process</Item><Item>Ability to track progress and tailor measures accordingly</Item><Item>3D-Model of the construction site and data of the building process for external use (API)</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Ensuring connectivity on the construction site and large data packages for multiple IoT-devices\\nLaying the groundwork for the exponentially increasing use of IoT-devices: By using the Craidar system, in combination with construction-specific Wifi-amplifiers, it allows for a high throughput of data and enables the proper use of IoT-based machinery. Here, the system serves purely as a hardware component. The Wifi-Module also enables the usage of the LIDAR-Module described below.\\nEfficiency gains and cost savings by enabling usage of connectivity-based services: The use of IoT-devices on the construction site is made possible by the Craidar system, it enhances further effectivity growth, more transparency, time- and therefore cost-savings.\\nAccurate assessment of the building progress \\nTransparency about the status of the building process: By generating point clouds using LIDAR-sensors and cameras at the same time to ensure good cross-sensor calibration, the system generates precise overviews of the construction site and can translate it into a 3D-model of the building.\\nAbility to track progress and tailor measures accordingly: The data generated can be used to assess the building progress. Therefore, project planners keep an overview of the status of the construction site. Measures can be adjusted accordingly, and the project gains flexibility.\\n3D-Model of the construction site and data of the building process for external use (API): The data generated can easily be used by other services using an open application programming interface (API) for data exchange. This enables other software providers (such as BIM and project management tools) to feed the Craidar data into their models. \\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Acquisition (personal assistance/key account manager)</Item><Item>Leveraging partner companies&#8217; customers</Item><Item>Trusted, long-term, personal partnership</Item><Item>Continuous advice, service, and support</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>Acquisition (personal assistance/key account manager): Interviews with construction companies showed that the industry highly depends on key account managers of the large machinery manufacturers when it comes to machine purchases. Offering discounts, warranties and especially high service levels, they manage to sell machines very efficiently. Often, they have a very strong customer relationship. Craidar, therefore, has to aim for an even closer customer relationship than the industry standard. Personal contact, a large field-sales team as well as a strong collaboration between sales, key account management and (spare-part) after-sales are the key elements to reach this goal.\\nTrusted, long-term, personal partnership: The Craidar team should actively aim for an excelling, one-stop service level where any need of a customer can be solved by calling his or her assigned key account manager. To achieve this, service task forces consisting of members of all potentially involved departments have to be set up. The key account managers do not serve as sales agents here, like in other business cases, but more as coordinators of all resources Craidar provides. The sales team should be a separate union which generates leads (inside-sales), pitches the product and closes first-time deals only (field-sales and outside sales). A state-of-the-art CRM and sales tool such as Salesforce will help to achieve this goal, allowing the key account managers to also include live usage-data from the system to monitor customers.\\nContinuous advice, service, and support: By incorporating usage-tracking features into all connected modules, Craidar will be able to detect increased and decreased, and later even right and wrong usage of the system. Leveraging this data, customers can be coached on how to perfectly utilize their system to increase efficiency as well as to prevent breakdowns in the long-run.\\n</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Direct mail and sales Partner network and recommendations (leveraging manufacturers of IoT-devices) Referral program through a network of construction companies Trade fairs and industry summits</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>The construction industry is a highly conservative and fragmented industry, dominated by family businesses. Construction companies can be easily reached through direct (postal) mail to approach cold contacts and inform about our product. Provided these companies have an interest in our product, the sales team can then go into direct contact and start negotiations. Also, as complex hardware sales require a lot of trust on the customer site (reliability, support in case of maintenance problems and more), direct sales are an appropriate B2B channel. Craidar can leverage partnerships with industry associations and build the groundwork for a wide-spanned partner and customer network.\\nWhile construction companies are always competing for projects, there still is a strong network between these firms. Craidar will incentivize satisfied customers to refer products. Possible incentivizes are as aforementioned free data packages, discounts on existing orders or via revenue shares. \\nManufacturers of cranes, construction machines and IoT-devices as well as providers of construction-related software systems comprise the ideal partner network. These companies are perfect candidates to become sales partners. Craidar would provide a revenue share to advertise and recommend the hardware solution.\\nFor tool manufacturers, trade fairs are still very important to network with other companies and to successfully position themselves as a premium brand. Being present at these tool fairs will make construction companies and tool manufacturers pay attention to our product, as well as help with building connections to potential customers and partners. \\nUsing the strong cross-company ties of the industry, Craidar plans to leverage word-of-mouth advertisement by setting up a product referral program, which incentivizes happy customers to either sign new customers or to actively advertise Craidar via their channels. Companies could be incentivized via free data packages, discounts on existing orders or revenue shares.\\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Technical hardware know-how</Item><Item>Patents on the LIDAR-module</Item><Item>Sales network (manufacturers of IoT-devices and crane manufacturers)</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>One of the most crucial resources for Craidar is the technical hardware know-how. The combination and calibration of different sensor types are critical to guarantee a high level of data accuracy. While the hardware itself is not complicated and easy to replicate, Craidar relies on the secure and easy attachment to cranes, as well as software developers to develop the interfaces for communication. Craidar has to tailor the product to work in all use-cases on differently sized construction sites across the globe. It is important to process and prepare the data for further usage. Therefore, technical know-how is key for market success. &#13;\\nThe most important resource of Craidar is intellectual property. While the Wifi-Module cannot be patented, Craidar relies on patents for the LIDAR-Module. Filing patents on the LIDAR-Module allow a competitive advantage and restrict the competition severely in relevant core markets such as Germany. Patents on the LIDAR-Module will ensure long lasting profits from the developed system. &#13;\\nTo sell the Craidar-System, a sales network of manufacturers of IoT-devices, construction machines and cranes is highly important. A partner network containing both IoT-tool-providers with a long history in construction and strong sales networks (e.g. Hilti) is key to promote the Wifi-Module. BIM- and project-management-software-providers can be interesting partners to promote the use of the LIDAR-Module.&#13;\\n</text></Key-Resources-Text><Key-Activities-Canvas><Item>Continuous product development and improvement</Item><Item>Building and maintaining partner network</Item><Item>Training of employees for montage and usage</Item></Key-Activities-Canvas><Key-Activities-Text><Text>Continuous product development and improvement: The LIDAR-Module can be built similar to how it is currently used in the automotive industry. Correct calibration of the Wifi-Module to provide a reliable connection will require a lot of effort, but the technology already exists. Since the technology for both modules is already available, developing the initial system becomes feasible. To beat arising competition, Craidar needs to keep this technological advance and invest a lot of effort into R&amp;D. Craidar also needs to ensure a consistently high product quality to ensure customer satisfaction, making regular bug fixes and updates necessary. Another important part of product development is the maintenance of the API to ensure a functioning interface between the LIDAR-module and the connected devices.\\nBuilding and maintaining partner network: Partners are construction-related manufacturers of IoT-devices, BIM- and project-management-software providers, as well as crane manufacturers who want to offer additional services to their customers. These groups share an interest in a more connected and better-steered construction site, making them the perfect partners for a revenue-share sales partner model. It will be necessary to incentivize crane manufacturers to offer our module with the sale of a crane. In the long run, Craidar will have to negotiate contracts and conditions that enable software companies to use the results of the LIDAR-module and to have a large number of software companies using the results from the LIDAR-Module. \\nTraining of employees for montage and usage: To use the Craidar-System properly, construction companies need to know to properly use the system. After the first purchase, companies will be assigned a dedicated Craidar sales person instructing employees on how and where to mount the system in the form of a workshop of up to 3 days.\\n</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>Non-recurring Revenue</Item><Item>Wifi-device and software</Item><Item>Additional Wifi-modules/amplifiers</Item><Item>LIDAR-device and software</Item><Item>Recurring Revenue</Item><Item>Revenue share for data pay per use/flat rate for data usage from telecommunications providers</Item><Item>Income from customer support</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>Non-recurring Revenue&#13;\\nCraidar&#8217;s major revenue stream is based on hardware sales, with the Wifi-Module as the primary product. Clients can buy and lease the Wifi-Module as the basic unit. For complex building sites, the unit comes with software providing an optimal strategy for setting up the module together with additional amplifiers. The additional amplifiers can be bought or leased. They will be provided through an external partner with Craidar adjusting these for the use on construction sites to ensure an optimal connectivity coverage. The combined forces of the Wifi-Module and advanced amplifying systems ensures a high-quality network.&#13;\\nA second revenue stream will come from selling and leasing the LIDAR-System together with a basic 3D-software, making sense of the data generated so that they can be used by other applications. The LIDAR-System requires the purchase of the WIFI-System. The price of the system depends on the type of crane used and the type of sensors built into the crane. The classical hardware components can be purchased together with cranes to enable more use cases. The earnings are generated by direct sales of the module and will make up most of the revenues generated.&#13;\\nRecurring Revenue&#13;\\nCraidar will also make revenue from the consumed data. In cooperation with existing telecommunication providers, Craidar allows choosing between different offerings of selected data packages or flats suited to the needs of construction sites. Craidar will negotiate the terms and conditions as part of a frame agreement and sell the access to the target group to selected telecommunication providers.&#13;\\nLastly, Craidar derives revenue streams from services around the system. This includes but is not limited to added revenues for special customer services, such as premium 24-hour and on-site support and additional help with the implementation of the system that diverges from the original setup services that come with the purchase. &#13;\\n</Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Suppliers and device manufacturer</Item><Item>Telecommunications providers</Item><Item>Manufacturers of construction machines</Item><Item>Providers of BIM- and project-management-software</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Suppliers and device manufacturers: Craidar will provide clients with a Wifi-Module that supplies the construction site with an internet connection. This unit will be attached to cranes and other elevated points on construction sites. For the Wifi-Module, Craidar will acquire the required antennas, cables, satellite dishes, as well as other hardware components from third-party providers. There is a large number of suppliers available for these components. For the LIDAR-Module, Craidar will produce weather- and a wind-proof case containing all LIDAR-Sensors and cameras. The LIDAR-modules are offered in different types according to the height of the crane and its technical specifications. &#13;\\nTelecommunications providers: For the Wifi-Module to be functional, telco providers are required to provide an internet connection for the construction site. There are three major ways to supply the Wifi-Module with data. For construction sites with an already developed infrastructure, a landline is the optimal solution. For remote construction sites with no landline connection, cellular-networks will be used. If no cellular networks are available, satellite-connection serves as the last option.&#13;\\nManufacturers of construction machines and IoT-devices: Increased availability of IoT-devices for the construction site will raise usefulness and profitability of the Wifi-Module for clients. Since there is currently only a small number of these devices available, Craidar will partner with manufacturers of construction machines to promote machines using IoT-technologies to enable the tracking of usage, predictive maintenance, and other use cases. These partnerships will in return also promote the Craidar-System.&#13;\\nProject management software providers: To fully utilize the LIDAR-Module, Craidar builds on partners who make use of the additional collected data. BIM- and project-management-software-providers are ideal partners, as they can use the collected data to evaluate the process, compare the actual progress to the plan of the project and use the data to display current and expected delays. The data generated by the system is given out to them for free via an API (application programming interface) to incentivize software providers to promote Craidar&#8217;s hardware as a technical enabler for their services.&#13;\\n</Text></Key-Partners-Text><Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Item>Medium and large construction companies</Item><Item>Crane manufacturers</Item></Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Customer-Segmentation-Text><Text>Medium-sized and large construction companies: Construction companies can buy the Craidar-System and install it in their existing cranes or buy it together with cranes from partner companies.

Customers pre-configure their devices targeted to their needs concerning sensor accuracy and size of the construction size. The systems, later on, can be modified according to up- or downgrade wishes. Also, additional components such as Wifi-amplifiers can be purchased with the system. Since the system is better suited for complex building surroundings, large and mid-sized construction companies are the key target group.&#13;\\nCrane manufacturers: Crane manufacturers can be sales partners as well as customer, depending on the intensity of collaboration chosen. By using the patented Craidar-System in their cranes, they can keep the technological edge without having to invest too much in sensor R&amp;D themselves.

Development of the original system is relatively simple since the Craidar-System builds on already existing technology. To stay competitive, Craidar will have to make large investments into R&amp;D for continuous improvement of its system. For processing the data generated by the LIDAR-Module, maintenance of IT-infrastructure will also play an important part. Personnel costs will also be an important part of the fixed costs. Employees are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure, develop hardware and software, as well as marketing, sales, and 24/7 customer support, which will focus on building relationships with construction companies and manufacturers of construction machines.&#13;\\nVariable Costs&#13;\\nThe largest part of the variable costs consists of material costs, such as sensors. Depending on the unit bought, the number of components, as well as the costs for the components varies. Purchasing of material will not be outsourced, because, in order to persist on the market, a high and consistent quality needs to be offered to clients. Manufacturing of the final product will be another part of the variable costs; this will be outsourced to a third party. Telco-providers will have to be paid a revenue share for the data used by customers. &#13;\\n</Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler-Industry: In this scenario, the domination of customized houses within a fragmented market will lead to the need for a high speed of building houses.

At a higher level, such deviations happen due to a lack of knowledge about the design on the contractor&#8217;s side, and at a lower level due to mistakes by the workers. Unskilled workers are prone to make errors in building complicated construction structures, fitting of various appliances such as positioning pipes and wires in a wall, and in installing proprietary equipment from third-party vendors. Often these mistakes are detected too late, due to insufficient monitoring and documentation of what is built. BIM is a highly useful technology that has always had the potential to alleviate many pain points of the construction industry. However, the construction industry has been slow in adopting the technology, and consequently, BIM has not yet been fully utilized as an on-site collaboration tool.\\nWith BIMLENS we make BIM accessible on-site to help workers in executing construction tasks and to allow documentation of design deviations. BIMLENS uses AR (AR) techniques to guide workers in properly installing complex components.\\nBIMLENS comes in two forms: First, a software that can be installed on regular Android and iOS smartphones, and second, as specialized AR goggles. The core feature is centered around guiding the worker to perform a certain task by showing instructions, virtually overlaid on the construction entity. For instance, if a worker is installing water pipes in a wall, BIMLENS will guide her by showing the exact position and orientation of the pipes in the wall. BIMLENS also makes the BIM model available on every worker&#8217;s smartphone. Therefore, in addition to AR, the instructions can be embedded inside the model so that the worker can see the model dynamically changing on her smartphone as per the construction requirement which will allow the worker to get a better idea of fitting a particular component. Since it is not always possible to follow the original design, and some components may be built differently from the design, as a secondary feature, BIMLENS allows documenting these changes inside the model for that specific component.\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Bridge gap between BIM usage in design process and on-site to increase BIM compliance</Item><Item>Mitigate lack of knowledge of on-site workers caused by worker attrition and subcontracting</Item><Item>Reduce construction flaws that lead to high rework costs if identified late</Item><Item>Update BIM if a task cannot be performed exactly as planned</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>By providing detailed instructions on how to perform tasks to construction workers via a non-obtrusive AR interface, BIMLENS is valuable on four dimensions: BIMLENS increases on-site BIM usage, reduces construction flaws, mitigates workers&#8217; lack of knowledge, and enables workers to document deviations from the model easily.&#13;\\nCurrently, BIM models are used on-site as plotted 2D plans which do not include all the information that can be attached to objects in BIM. Thus, the value of BIM is not realized to its fullest extent on-site. With BIMLENS, workers can directly access the model including all its information. By visualizing BIM details in AR, it is easier to understand, and instructions help to assure that progress is made as intended. As flaws often require expensive rework in later stages of the project, significant cost reductions can be realized and time schedules can be met more easily. Third, on-site workers are often subcontracted, and attrition is high. Thus, knowledge management and education of workers takes time, and no learning curve can be leveraged as workers leave, once they&#8217;ve gained experience. BIMLENS supports workers along the process with specific instructions that help to perform the task. Fourth, workers may sometimes need to intentionally deviate from the model. With BIMLENS, workers can document their work by, e.g. attaching images to the respective objects to enable designers to update the BIM model to necessary deviations. This dramatically increases the value of BIM in late construction stages as well as operations and maintenance.&#13;\\nCustomer Relationships&#13;\\nBIMLENS is not a self-service product since BIM is not standardized and custom integrations with different providers are necessary. Thus, customer relationships are rather long-term and personal. Each customer has one single point of contact, a customer success manager, that offers support and helps with problems. The main goal is to retain customers on the monthly subscription once they signed the initial agreement. Increasing revenues by increasing the adoption of existing customers are more promising that trying to generate revenues from new customers only. In the long run, BIMLENS can also be deployed without the need for personal interaction when BIM APIs are well defined, and appliance makers are onboard. At this stage, self-service customers could be monitored and contacted by the customer success managers when a significant upselling potential is identified, or the customer is otherwise likely to churn.&#13;\\nBIMLENS requires training of on-site and off-site managers at any point in time, as the technology is new and understanding the functionality is crucial for them to lead the adoption on-site. Workshops with them lead by BIMLENS consultants are an essential part of the onboarding of new construction companies. After the first onboarding of existing staff, the customer can decide to either have an expert inhouse who onboard new employees or pay for workshops conducted by BIMLENS consultants also at later stages.&#13;\\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Long-term and close relationship to drive change management</Item><Item>Co-creation with early customers</Item><Item>Strong focus on onboarding of new customers</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>BIMLENS is not a self-service product since BIM is not standardized and custom integrations with different providers are necessary.

Especially since customer relationships are long-term and close, sales activities need to be more direct and personal. Trade fairs are an important channel to meet decision makers from the construction industry early on. The fairs allow us to be efficient in the beginning since we can schedule many personal meetings in a short amount of time and get feedback on BIMLENS and establish the first partnerships.&#13;\\nDirect sales are our most important channel in the core customer segment. Most of the interactions will be outbound as creating awareness to drive inbound is expensive in the beginning. Later, PR and print/online advertisements can be leveraged to increase efficiency by generating inbound leads. Events at which decision makers of the construction industry meet will stay an important channel.&#13;\\nSince BIMLENS is implemented by the construction company leading a project and then used by subcontractors collaborating on the project, these subcontractors can make use of BIMLENS without procuring it themselves. Directly selling to subcontractors that lead other projects but have already utilized BIMLENS, is a promising channel as the sales effort to explain the solution is reduced significantly.&#13;\\nSince architects and designers profit from increased BIM compliance and since they are advanced users of BIM, they could act as sales partners of BIMLENS. Using sales partners that already have close customer relationships makes the process more scalable and allows BIMLENS to grow quickly without a large internal sales team.&#13;\\nCustomer Segments&#13;\\nBIMLENS is a B2B solution targeted at medium and large construction companies. The customer segments are uniform and value-driven instead of cost-driven:&#13;\\nThe core customer segment is large construction companies. With increasing BIM penetration, due to regulatory requirements and technological developments, this customer segment looks for smart ways to leverage BIM for their benefit. This segment leads projects and manages many subcontractors on-site. Thus, they benefit the most from the core value proposition of not having to educate the changing workforce by setting up BIMLENS for their projects and providing subcontractors access to it which might also involve hardware. Also, they manage projects of significant size to have the resources to invest in new technologies. The first subsegment within this broad core segment is early adopters. Companies with young management teams will most probably lead to the adoption of AR technology.&#13;\\nApart from the core segment, specialized construction companies who might also act as subcontractors can benefit from BIMLENS as well. As they do not lead projects, they depend on getting access to BIM. Furthermore, it depends on their specialization whether BIMLENS is meaningful to them, e.g. demolition companies probably do not need frequent instructions.&#13;\\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Software, IP, patents</Item><Item>Developer platform</Item><Item>Talent</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>The main resource is our software with the research conducted in the field of AR combined with our learnings for the BIMLENS user experience.

Due to the wide range of appliances that constructors have to install, BIMLENS\\' product eliminates the need for installers to have extensive experience by providing them with appropriate on-site guidance for each task they do. Since the market is highly fragmented, the investment possibilities of customers are reduced. This means that BIMLENS will need to focus on working with mainstream products which are already owned by the users and implement a SaaS model. Since the impact of the platform is so high, appliance suppliers will have a high incentive of integrating with the guidance platform and becoming partners.</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: Featuring a construction industry which is very centralized yet offering products tailored to the needs of each, this scenario helps BIMLENS push technology to the limits with a high-tech company owned devices, acquired by the giants of the industry. This availability of capital increases the risk that more tasks on the construction site will be automated, but, as showcased by present day\\'s state of the automotive industry, enough tasks will be sufficiently complex to require human workers. As in the previous scenario, BIMLENS\\'s main product will be on-site guidance due to the diverse array of products constructors have to interact with. Depending on how the construction companies decide to tackle the development of custom software, BIMLENS might face competition from them or have them as partners in co-creating the product. Finally, another impact of the high centralization will be a reduction in the number of BIM software suites in use by the industry, simplifying integration for BIMLENS</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winners Build It All: A world where all the buildings are standardized, and there are very few players in the construction market is one where work is most efficient. Driven by large amounts of available capital and streamlined designs, automation of the construction sites reaches its peak, with robots performing the repetitive tasks. The jobs for which human workers remain cheaper than robots will also be dominated by repetition, but at a higher level, between individual projects. This implies that on-site guidance, BIMLENS\\'s starting product, becomes irrelevant. To compensate, BIMLENS has to shift its focus to documenting executed work and to assisting new workers in learning the tasks they need to do. In this way, the risk can be mitigated, and the company can take advantage of other aspects of the construction landscape, such as ubiquitous high-tech AR devices and the reduced variety of appliances the software has to integrate with.</Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: This scenario is characterized by an industry fragmented to the fullest, but in which each actor does work the same way because of standardization. While automation is not a big risk in this case, due to the lacking spending power of the companies, the reduced complexity of the construction site does represent a threat that BIMLENS has to tackle. Since tasks become repetitive, both at the project and day-to-day level, most of the workers\\' learning on the job is done when they join the workforce and guidance is not required afterward. In this setup, BIMLENS can pivot towards providing the initial training to minimize the onboarding period, and it can further adapt by providing a documenting solution for individual steps of the workers\\' tasks. On the hardware side, the company should concentrate on mass-market devices, which are owned by the constructors. Together with a SaaS business model, this strongly reduces the need for upfront investments and optimally targets the market.</Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Loqui</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Enabling Simple Communication and Task Management on the Construction Site </H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>Often, a sizeable amount of time spent on the construction site is for delegating tasks to construction workers and collecting progress updates. Since these sites could be huge, the time and effort spent in physically meeting a supervisor or worker usually accounts for almost a quarter of the working day. In addition to this, the construction companies face several complaints from residents and office workers situated in the vicinity of the site. To address these problems, we have come up with a solution called Loqui. Loqui is a digital tool for efficient communication between all stakeholders on the construction site, namely the site coordinator, the supervisor, and the construction worker. The application is tackling the alarming statistics of communication being the single most time-consuming item in the coordinators&#8217; daily work schedule and adding to it, existing digital solutions failing to pass the adoption hurdle posed by the construction workers as the end users. On the top layer, the application provides a dashboard, clearly depicting the project structure which is comprised of tasks, their deadlines, and the workers assigned. The coordinating role can create multiple project instances, decompose it into smaller units and assign them to individuals or groups with an associated deadline. The executing role can view all relevant tasks including priority, location, description, associated team members, and due date. Also, the worker can indicate that he is working on a specific task and mark it as &#8216;to-be reviewed&#8217; if it has been completed. The update of workflows is implemented by a simple drag-and-drop functionality, emulating the concept of &#8216;Kanban boards&#8217; which find their origins in the software development industry. This core functionality is supported by automatic notifications for task updates to inform the respective supervisor about the project progress or delay on the one hand but also to notify preceding or succeeding subcontractors about potential delays which they are dependent upon. This helps bridge the communication gap between subcontractors in a highly synchronized workflow setting. The value of this application increases with the size of the project and the number of stakeholders involved and helps to manage this complexity. Another function that soothes the pain of the surrounding residents is the provision of the dashboard via a QR code attached to the construction fence. This dashboard is enriched with information about the current phase of the construction process and estimates of water and electricity downtimes as well as loud noises coming from the construction site. </Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Process transparency</Item><Item>Trust towards subcontractors</Item><Item>Cost reduction</Item><Item>Reduction of the language barrier</Item><Item>Planning security</Item><Item>Easier work delegation</Item><Item>Reduction of paper work</Item><Item>Public information</Item><Item>Convenience to construction workers</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Often, a lot of site supervisors complain that most of their day is wasted in running around to ensure everything is in order. In order to solve this problem, Loqui is a digital tool to make communication more efficient and effective on the construction site. While researching the feasibility of our tool, we came across other pain-points that could be addressed with the help of our platform. In an effort to enhance the construction process, we aim to develop a tool that addresses these problems. \\n\\nReducing the need for interaction: Supervisors will be able to delegate tasks directly to individuals or groups of workers through the application. Also, workers can view a to-do list of tasks assigned to them with information on where it is to be performed. After completing the task, the worker can update the progress, thereby sending a notification to his supervisor, who can then review the task. Apart from this, the supervisor can also &#8216;request to review&#8217; a certain task. Consequently, there is hardly any need for physical interaction between workers and supervisors. \\n\\nMore reliable communication: Currently, communication is done verbally or on paper, which is subject to damage or getting lost. With Loqui, all communication is in digital form. Therefore, everything is automatically documented and stored for as long as required. The information could be used in other projects or at a later stage in the same project. \\n\\nFaster communication: Construction projects running overtime is very prevalent. By reducing the number of face-to-face interactions between the workers and supervisors, we contract the direct task assignment via mobile devices between the involved parties. Therefore, enabling faster decision-making and reducing idle-time between tasks. \\n\\nIncreasing transparency: Since all tasks are well documented, and to some extent standardized, there will be no discrepancy between what workers are supposed to do and what they think they have to do. Also, the supervisor will tend to give more work to a certain worker if he has always completed his work and updated the progress on time. Also, people working and residing near the construction site can easily scan a QR code on the fence in order to know a basic schedule of the noise, electricity and water downtime. </Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Intense and direct relationships</Item><Item>Feedback integration</Item><Item>Relational sales process</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>With an already customer-centric approach, it is very important for us to keep the customer satisfied at every step of the construction process. Being new to the market, we want to involve the clients&#8217; opinion even in the development phase to come up with a product that caters to their needs. \\n\\nIntense and direct relationships: We seek to establish an intensive customer liaison and support with active key account management. If the user expresses a difficulty, then he can directly contact his customer success manager, who would either provide him with a solution or set up a meeting to discuss and resolve this issue. This would leave the customer with a sense of comfort as well as safety while using the product. \\n\\nFeedback integration: Another important factor is to gather feedback from customers and include them in the product development process. If the user reports a problem in the functionality or an interface glitch, we plan to reward him with benefits such as a discount on &#8216;x&#8217; number of users per month. This would further incentivize the client to provide feedback and help us create a better product. \\n\\nRelational sales process: Having a SaaS-based model, we will be taking proactive strides to engage the customers with online content, mails, and regular events. A healthy relationship with the customer will make it easier for him to approach us in case of an issue instead of directly switching to another tool or unsubscribing from the service. </Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Online in-/outbound (targeted advertisement, LinkedIn, contact form on website, newsletter, blog)</Item><Item>Offline in-/outbound (phone calls, billboards, pilot projects/prototyping)</Item><Item>Directly approaching target customers (large construction companies, architects) via exhibitions, uni network, on-site visits</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>To maximize Loqui&#8217;s reach, a well-rounded mix of offline and online channels is utilized with a slightly stronger emphasis on offline measures to conform to currently used communication channels.

Such channels would contain targeted advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook, where you can narrow down your target audience according to personal and professional criteria. Professional networks such as LinkedIn also provide opportunities to reach out to your target audience.

Since the value increases with each acquired customer, user-based pricing was chosen. The customer can unsubscribe at any point in time for the next month and can sign up again, e.g. when the next construction project starts. Thus, Loqui aims to provide a flexible solution tailored to the specific need of the construction industry to cope with planning uncertainty. The fees vary between small and medium-sized companies, who are paying 29.90&#8364; per month per user with a slight premium over large companies with more than 25 employees who are charged with 24.90&#8364; per month per user. \\n\\nTraining/Customer Support: To increase the adoption of the digital solution and resolve potentially arising issues beforehand, we aim to provide introductory courses for supervisors and construction workers alike.

As the product pricing varies with the size of the construction project, it makes sense to segment the customer base by size. \\n\\nSmall- and medium-sized construction companies: This segment is, by far, the largest in Germany which makes it attractive from a market size perspective. For smaller companies, the ratio of the amount of time saved per employee to the total money spent is higher. Hence, small and medium-sized companies have to pay a slight premium for the application usage. \\n\\nLarge construction companies: Although there are relatively few companies in this segment, the value of the application increases disproportionately with the size of the construction project. Despite the time savings per employee being smaller than with small and medium-sized companies, the perceived value is significantly higher, which makes this segment the most attractive for Loqui. \\n\\n</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Human resources</Item><Item>IT infrastructure</Item><Item>Marketing and sales</Item><Item>Office</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>Fixed costs: Regardless of Loqui&#8217;s success, there are running costs associated with operating the business. For instance, the company needs to pay for office space, associated supplies, and IT infrastructure required to store the customer&#8217;s data. Furthermore, salaries that are not profit-related can be considered fixed costs as well. Due to the nature of the product being a smartphone app, the fixed costs are comparatively low. \\n\\nVariable costs: Profit-related salaries or ones for outsourced product development fall under this category. Besides that, all spending for marketing purposes is proportional to the output of increased product sales. The provision of customer support services also poses a variable cost position by buying from local service providers. The leasing of smartphone devices to construction workers would also require us to either buy devices for our inventory or share our profits from that revenue source with the partner. </Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry: \\nA fragmented market would entail a greater number of stakeholders involved leading to a higher complexity associated with the construction process. This would create the need for a tool to effectively organize and manage workflows. As a result, Loqui would thrive in such a market. Also, a high degree of customization will amount to more variables involved in the market as well as the construction process. With more uncertainty in the demand and type of building, it would be helpful to have Loqui in order to provide some structure to the process and at least save time and effort spent in task delegation and getting updates. However, this might require us to tailor our tool every time to suit the needs of our customers. Due to an increase in demand in response to both the trends, the &#8216;butler industry&#8217; extreme scenario would be probably the best case for our product. </Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: \\nThis scenario is essentially what recently happened to the electronics retail industry. Having a fully centralized market, where only a few construction giants exist, would streamline the entire construction process. Each of these companies would have their approach, process, and very likely even their tool for construction management. Since the capital availability of those few companies will be large due to higher margins and synergy effects resulting from the centralization, there will also be an increased role of automation. This does not pair very well with the idea of Loqui and therefore, might be a major hurdle to stay on the market. To still have a stable market share, we would try to partner up with one of the construction giants and focus only on their process. On the other hand, having a customized market might still leave room for Loqui to be used because of the need to coordinate complex tasks that usually have not been done before. </Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winner Builds it All: \\nIn the extreme scenario of full centralization, only one or a few companies would employ all the workforce and oversee all construction projects. Since this aggregation of workforce eases its coordination, the need for our communication solution would decrease compared to today. Full standardization naturally decreases process complexity and reduces the need for visualization and coordination solutions such as ours. However, despite all workforce being aggregated under one leading company, our solution still provides value for prevailing problems such as reducing language barriers, streamlining feedback loops and synchronizing tasks. Although this scenario is among the least favorable, Loqui would still be able to provide value to the construction site, especially with planned functions such as automatic schedule generation or modularized processes. </Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: \\nIn a fully fragmented market, there is a large need for roles and functions coordinating the many stakeholders in the construction process. Since Loqui aims to solve the problem of complexity arising from the increasing number of stakeholders, this extreme scenario would prove to be highly favorable for our business idea. On the other side, a full grade of standardization in the construction process being coupled with full fragmentation will favor automation, which would, in turn, reduce the need for our solution due to the decreased amount of human labor. However, since our product roadmap contains the modularization of process tasks for reuse purposes, higher standardization would foster the usage of this already useful feature. Overall, Loqui would be a competitive product in this scenario. </Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Modulo - Plug &amp; Play Living\\n</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Customizable Modular Apartment Solutions\\n</H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>The shortage of affordable living space in ever more dense urban areas is one of the most pressing issues in Germany and around the world. The advantages of modular building methods are apparent &#8211; low building costs, short fabrication time, and effective use of the scarce available space. However, modular construction and prefabrication have been mostly applied to the serial construction of, for example, hotel rooms, where customization is not required. As projects like residential buildings require a higher level of individualization, the benefits of this construction approach have not been leveraged efficiently to meet customer demand. \\nModulo resolves this by offering modular, prefabricated apartments which can be customized and ordered online. These modules have standardized outer dimensions and can be &#8220;plugged&#8221; into matching slots of a Modulo frame, a pre-built multi-story structure on-site. \\nTo cover the demand for available slots with the supply of frames, Modulo partners up with project developers who buy frames from Modulo to offer slots in urban areas across the country. On the Modulo website end users can then buy available slots and configure and order according to modules. Each ordering process can be done completely online. In case of questions, customers can request consultation on design and usability by an in-house expert. The customer order is then forwarded to a production partner who prefabricates the module. Upon completion, the module is transported to the construction site and installed into the project developer&#8217;s frame. Modulo thereby connects end users with project developers and with the help of digital technology captures the sweet spot between standardization and customization. </Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Affordable living</Item><Item>Short fabrication and transport time</Item><Item>One-stop shop solution</Item><Item>Customization possibilities</Item><Item>Fixed price and completion date guaranteed</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Customer acquisition</Item><Item>Comparably low initial investment</Item><Item>Reduced risk and organizational overhead</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Modulo offers a construction method, which allows for a high degree of prefabrication and standardization and at the same time customization of the interior of the modules. Additionally, Modulo&#8217;s online platform connects end users to available slots in frames built by project developers.\\n\\nThe standardized design and fabrication of the modules allow Modulo to sell affordable apartments to end users directly. Through the online configurator, the process of designing and buying modules is simplified as much as possible. From the size of the bathroom to the painting and floor material, the customer can easily customize his or her module(s) according to personal preferences and needs. To guide the user through this process, best-practice solutions for different sizes, requirements, and preferences are provided. To meet different size requirements, modules can be connected to form an apartment unit. The online configurator serves as the single touchpoint and offers the customer a one-stop shop solution. The system of frames and modules, as well as the comparably high degree of standardization, allow prefabricating the modules. Consequently, the customer benefits from a guaranteed price and completion date.\\nProject Developer\\nFor project developers, Modulo offers attractive investment opportunities with a comparably low initial investment, as well as reduced risks and organizational overhead. The construction method of using a frame and modules, which are plugged in later, allows the investor to provide the initial investment for the frame only. As the modules are directly paid by the end user, the project developer does not need to cover these costs and lowers his investment risk. The high degree of standardization and prefabrication reduces the risk of overrunning time and budget since construction defects, and change requests are minimized and material utilization optimized. This also leads to a lowered organizational effort for the project developer during the building phase. The effort for marketing and sales activities is reduced as well since Modulo supports with sales by putting available slots online and takes an active part in customer acquisition.</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Online and personally assisted selling process</Item><Item>Provision of functional best practice design templates</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Personally-assisted co-creation</Item><Item>Individual consultation</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>End User\\nOnline and personally assisted selling process with a single touchpoint: Modulo offers a very intuitive and easy way to configure apartments even for inexperienced customers. This can be done the very short amount of time without even contacting an architect or an interior designer. Customers can start designing their home by choosing from a list of templates and are guided through the customization process with hints and best practice examples. The configurator detects unfeasible or undesired details and alerts the user by giving suggestions on how to solve the design challenge. At the end of the configuration process, an expert reviews the design and further advises the customer. After the review, the apartment can be ordered and will be directly delivered to the construction site in a very short time, compared to conventional construction projects.\\nProject Developer\\nPersonally-assisted co-creation and individual consultation: Modulo maintains a very close relationship with project developers, who are at the same time key partners and customers of the company. Modulo supports them during the planning phase of their building by assigning a key account manager to each project developer to maximize the service quality and optimize the outcome. After the completion of the construction, Modulo is still in close contact to ensure a smooth process for each ordered module. Moreover, Modulo cooperates with project partners in regards to marketing and sales activities of the available slots through the online platform. Once all slots are filled with modules, the collaboration concerning that specific object is completed. However, Modulo strives to establish long-term relationships with project developers to ensure recurring order and spread its modular construction method and establish a wide network of Modulo frames. This relationship is limited the construction process of the frames since Modulo does not offer maintenance services.</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Online &amp; Offline Ads</Item><Item>Websites including Modulo&#8217;s online configurator</Item><Item>Showrooms</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Industry exhibitions and fairs</Item><Item>Direct marketing and sales</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>End User\\nOnline and offline ads: End users are mainly targeted and acquired through online and offline advertisement.

To keep track of this additional living space and to include it in the configurator, databases need to be constantly updated. Customers can then choose their favorite location out of many different possibilities.\\nOrganizing the manufacturing, transportation, and installation of modules: While the transport of the modules is carried out by a partner company, Modulo coordinates the process in order to optimize logistics. Modulo also coordinates the manufacturing process of the modules by synchronizing it with the delivery of the furniture and other facilities. On the construction site, a team of sub-contracted workers installs the modules into the frame.</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>Margin on module sales</Item><Item>Affiliate margin</Item><Item>Margin on frame sales</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>End User\\nThe margin on module sales: As stated in the cost structure, Modulo does not manufacture the modules itself but has them produced by a cooperating construction company. Modulo charges the customers a margin of 10% on the module sales which is added to the price the construction company charges. However, the module configurator states the total price for the customer. Since Modulo has no impact on the manufacturing costs, the only way to scale its revenue is to increase either the relative margin per module sold, the number of modules sold or the value of individual modules. \\nAffiliate margin: In addition to the margin on module sales, Modulo also earns a margin of 10% on the sale of furniture and add-on services, which are installed into the modules.\\nProject Developer\\nThe margin on frame sales: Project developers hire Modulo to build a frame on their building ground. Modulo commissions a partner construction company to build the frame and charges a margin. This margin currently amounts to 3% of the production costs. The total manufacturing costs depend on the volume of the project, meaning the lot size, height of the building, and total slots as well as the complexity of the project. Therefore, fixed pricing is not feasible. Sales growth can be generated in the same way as for the modules.\\nIn contrast to these, Modulo can choose from several subcontractors that build the frames. In case Modulo can find cheaper subcontractors that are equally reliable, it could lower the manufacturing costs and keep the same absolute margin. In that way, Modulo could boost its revenues as well. </Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Project Developers</Item><Item>Construction companies</Item><Item>Prefabrication companies manufacturing modules</Item><Item>Logistics companies transporting the modules</Item><Item>Subcontractors installing the modules</Item><Item>Interior and add-on service providers</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Project Developers: Being partners and customers at the same time, project developers hire Modulo to build frames for their real-estate projects and at the same time create additional locations and available slots for Modulo&#8217;s end-users.

This company builds the standardized frames developed by Modulo. To ensure quality standards and a time-efficient building process a long-term partnership is intended.\\nPrefabrication companies are manufacturing modules: Another strong partnership is established with prefabrication companies. This specialized company allows fast production of high-quality modules. It is important that this supplier is perfectly aligned with the plans and specifications generated by the configurator, as well as the entire production process.\\nLogistics companies transporting the modules: This company forms a key element in the supply chain. It handles the transport of the prefabricated modules from the manufacturer to the construction site. In a future scenario, this company would also execute the relocation of the modules when a customer decides to move to another place.\\nSubcontractors installing the modules: At the arrival of the modules on the construction site, a trained team of workers insert the modules into the frame and connects the wires and pipes of the standardized interface.

These groups have an interest in investing their money on a long-term basis instead of paying rent. Additionally, they prefer to live in cities and accept smaller living spaces. In return, Modulo can offer comparably cheap living solutions which can particularly attract young buyers. However, Modulo&#8217;s building method could also be attractive for other customer segments such as older adults, fast-growing companies, especially start-ups with a need for additional office space, government and municipal entities or any other group that is in need of fast, cheap, and scalable living solutions.\\nProject Developer: To enable the building method, Modulo targets project developers that finance the construction of the frames. These property developers look for rather low investments compared to projects of the same size using conventional building methods. At the same time, Modulo offers a relatively high ROI for the project developer. Besides corporate project developers, government and municipalities are potential customers for frames as well.</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Fixed Costs</Item><Item>Internal employees</Item><Item>Variable Costs</Item><Item>Payment of suppliers and partners</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>Fixed Costs\\nInternal employees: The largest item of fixed costs emerge from salaries, in particular, for software engineers, civil engineers, designers, architects, marketers, and salespeople. Software engineers develop and maintain Modulo&#8217;s online configurator. Thereby, they enable one of the key benefits Modulo offers to both of its customer groups, end-users and project developers. Civil engineers, designers, and architects develop and improve the module and frame and make design recommendations. Moreover, they review customized orders before the final commissions and consult clients in cases of problems or questions. To increase awareness and improve the reputation of Modolu&#8217;s building method, marketers and salespeople are particularly important in the beginning. \\nVariable Costs\\nPayment of suppliers and partners: Modulo does not cover any of the construction stages. Incoming orders for frames and modules are only processed and organized by Modulo and forwarded to partners and suppliers that take care of the actual production and construction. Since the costs for manufacturing are borne by the supplier, Modulo&#8217;s production costs are fully variable. They only accrue indirectly through the payments to executing construction companies for modules and frames. The level of variable costs depends mainly on the design of each project. Costs for suppliers and partners that occur along the supply chain are construction costs of the frames and the modules and transportation, furnishing and installation of the modules. </Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry:\\nIn a future where the construction market is fully fragmented, Modulo provides a lot of value for small project developers because it largely increases the customer base accessible to them. Furthermore, the required investments for a Modulo frame are far below classic residential buildings of comparable size, so it is also possible for smaller players in a fragmented market to initiate a Modulo project. However, the modules, even though customizable, will not be able to meet all specialized customer needs. A focus on core customer segments such as students and young families, who have only a limited budget and particularly value the price advantage, is therefore necessary. An advantage of this scenario can be the special status Modulo will likely occupy as it offers the benefits of standardization without neglecting the demand for customization possibilities. Nevertheless, Modulo&#8217;s business model is not a perfect fit for the &#8220;Butler Industry&#8221; scenario.</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon:\\nThe acquisition of project developers will be tough for Modulo in a world with a fully consolidated construction market. The few big construction companies will likely cover the project development part of the value chain themselves and lack incentives to pay Modulo for tasks they can easily perform on their own. Added to that, the margins on the highly customized buildings the construction companies can offer are probably higher than those on standardized Modulo solutions. On the other hand, it will be easy to incorporate all the projects of the few big players on the platform, which makes it very valuable to customers. The focus for Modulo in this scenario will be the module configurator, which could be sold as a white label solution to project developers and construction companies without setting up a Modulo platform.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winners build it all:\\nThe disadvantages of a consolidated market described in the &#8220;Construct-mazon&#8221; scenario also apply for this scenario &#8211; attracting project developers to the platform will be a challenge.

Again, the focus of Modulo will be the module configurator as a tool offered to the dominant market players, independent of the platform. Because they offer standardized solutions, the configurator has immense value for the major construction companies as they can respond to more individual customer needs while still being able to compete with the prices of fully standardized solutions. That makes selling the configurator a highly feasible business model for Modulo in this scenario. </Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars:\\nModulo can cover most of the market in this scenario as it offers standardized solutions but is also attractive for people who still value customization possibilities, which is a competitive edge in the market.

The low required initial investment and reduced risk come into play as additional advantages that Modulo offers for project developers. In this scenario, the number of possible suppliers for the modules and frames is high, and Modulo, therefore, possesses high market power. This allows Modulo to earn higher margins and to offer lower prices.

With Conas, they are supported in extracting information from complex construction plans and hence, in delivering their assigned tasks efficiently and according to requirements. Construction plans are usually developed as 3D models in architectural software and &#8211; in a steadily increasing number of cases &#8211; implemented in BIM. However, on construction sites, workers still rely on 2D paper-based plans as a source of measurements, material information, and interior object location. Conas provides a digitized solution in translating the information of a construction plan into audio. \\nFrom a technical perspective, this solution is enabled by the Conas design-to-speech software. Architects and construction companies upload their BIM and CAD design files to the Conas cloud, which translates every detail of the plans into natural language. The audio of this text is accessible via a smartphone application. Similar to speech assistants, such as Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, construction workers can ask Conas for information about the plan such as measures and materials. Additionally, construction workers can leave comments, e.g. in case of flaw detection. To play the audio and to enable smooth operation, Conas offers noise-canceling earphones and microphone as an optional product bundle. However, the app can connect to any Bluetooth-compatible headphones. \\nThe design of the Conas assistant allows for several functionalities: On the one hand, construction workers can receive information from construction plans while using their hands for the current task. Workers can ask for specific measures or materials without consulting the plan visually or having to recall mental notes. On the other hand, several application programming interfaces (APIs) enable additional services. To overcome language barriers on construction sites, we offer the audio pieces in multiple languages. In addition, text-to-speech services allow construction workers to communicate with the app for the sake of documentation. \\nThe target groups are construction companies of all sizes as well as subcontractors on-site, who are supported during the onboarding process and subsequent project phases. Customers sign up for the service via a monthly subscription for each account. Thus, Conas offers its service to a wide range of firms contributing to the construction process.\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Easy access to information from construction plans</Item><Item>Higher accuracy through controlled information flow</Item><Item>Greater safety during the workflow</Item><Item>Removal of language barriers</Item><Item>Documented errors</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Constructions plans are becoming more complex due to regulations and customer requirements. For example, with the increase of smart homes, unfamiliar requirements arise for the worker. Adhering to these requirements means that the workers must be able to extract the correct information from constructions plans. Conas allows users to obtain any information from the construction plan without having to lay aside construction tools, take off gloves or unfold the plan itself. As Conas is based on audio, the user can continue working with his hands while receiving information.\\nConas provides any detail required at any point in time during the workflow. This controlled flow of information makes it easier for the workers to understand the construction plan as they are no longer overwhelmed with a lot of information from the paper plan. Conas can help any user of a traditional paper plan, from a driller making holes to a worker installing windows.\\nThe product also allows the worker to make comments or observations while working. These comments are saved and also available to the supervisor who can then decide how to act on them. This feature allows for a smooth flow of information between workers and supervisors. Moreover, Conas can overcome language barriers which exist on construction sites as construction companies usually employ people from all over the world. As the software supports over 30 different languages, it can translate all information accordingly. Therefore, less time needs to be spent to instruct international employees on plans.  \\nConas, therefore, provides several benefits: First, the user can execute his task with greater accuracy by receiving precise information from the plans. Second, safety is increased because the user can use both hands for the workflow. Third, by leaving comments, the construction process is better documented. Finally, Conas saves time for the construction worker and hence, increases his productivity. \\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Setup support and training via learning videos</Item><Item>Key account management</Item><Item>Customer support via app or telephone</Item><Item>Product review via the app</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>Cultivating an appropriate B2B strategy is key to Conas&#8217; success. Continuous service and technical assistance enable a smooth onboarding process. Moreover, different business customers require different kinds of customer relationships, yet they face common challenges for product usage. \\nOnboarding: Customer onboarding requires the download of the app and the subsequent connection to the earphones. The app comes with learning videos guiding through the first steps, e.g. the upload of the construction plan. The respective file format needs to be provided by the architect, either via CAD or BIM. For firms that are technically not experienced, Conas offers an implementation service. It includes contacting the architect of the respective project and the upload of the data for the customer. To build strong relationships with lead customers, key accounts are set up, and personal assistance is provided during the first phase of the respective project. For example, on-site training for construction workers is provided. \\nProject support: Throughout projects, the combination of software, hardware, and interaction with the customer can lead to technical problems. In this case, the app provides a catalog on frequently emerging questions and challenges. If the worker cannot solve the problem himself, support service is available and reachable through the app. In emergency cases, Conas provides on-site support. This service is available to lead customers only. For feedback and product reviews, the Conas app itself provides an elaborate evaluation tool to directly capture the opinions of construction workers and improve the service afterward. \\n</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Direct mailing and company visits Construction fairs and trade journals Through project owners and project developers App stores and online sale of hardware Construction workers</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>The usage of digital products in the construction industry is currently quite rare. Therefore, Conas will utilize various channels to access the market. First, the initial focus will be to reach out to the customer directly. However, as a second strategy, project owners and developers are interesting distribution partners due to their extensive network of architects and construction firms. \\nDirect channels: Conas markets its product on a B2B basis. The challenge is to convince the representatives of construction firms that are possibly not involved in on-site work. To acquire these firms as customers and to get the product&#8217;s value proposition across, a direct approach is chosen. Conas&#8217; direct sales strategy includes direct mailing and company visits. Besides, to present the product to a larger audience, traditional media, and press, such as trade journals, help to create first touchpoints. Also, construction fairs offer great opportunities for potential customers to test the product. \\nIndirect channels: The second way to approach customers is via project owners or project development firms. These firms are the main actors for the tendering process and influence the processes on a construction site significantly. Another indirect channel is the construction workers, who have the interest to use Conas as it makes their work easier.\\nThe Conas application is available at all major app stores and provides a demo for testing the functionalities. The optional add-on hardware can be ordered online and is delivered via mail and package service. \\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Human Capital</Item><Item>Design-to-speech software and data</Item><Item>Additional software interfaces</Item><Item>Hardware</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>Human capital: Being a software company, skilled architects, designers, and software developers are key to Conas&#8217; success. In addition to this, experts in the application domain and their knowledge from the industry is important to create a product of high utility for critical construction situations. As Conas relies on many business partners and close customer relationships, employees with strong networking skills are required. \\nDesign-to-speech software and data: The value to the customer is brought by the design-to-speech software which is developed in-house. Our algorithms ensure that it recognizes various CAD and BIM models accurately. The cloud will collect a massive amount of data on construction plans and input from construction workers. This data is crucial to develop custom-fit solutions further. \\nAdditional software interfaces: The design-to-speech software is enriched with additional services of external providers. Therefore, the business partners providing APIs are key resources of Conas. For example, translation services address language barriers within the industry. Also, speech-to-text and text conversion services enable the communication between the worker and the software in the first place. By leaving comments, a worker can call attention to differences between plan and reality or other important notes. The status of an assigned task is documented and can be supervised. \\nHardware: The hardware interface between the software and the construction worker consists of high-quality earphones equipped with a microphone. Offering a compatible physical component accounting for the special environment of a construction site creates more value for the customers of Conas. The product needs to be designed robustly and with a noise-cancellation feature. \\n</text></Key-Resources-Text><Key-Activities-Canvas><Item>Key Activities</Item><Item>Development and maintenance of design-to-speech software and interfaces</Item><Item>Acquisition of software service providers and development of APIs</Item><Item>Customer acquisition and development of relationships</Item></Key-Activities-Canvas><Key-Activities-Text><Text>Conas assists construction workers with design-to-speech services available via earphones. To establish these functionalities, Conas focuses on four key activities: &#13;\\nDevelopment and maintenance of design-to-speech software and interfaces: The design-to-speech service is Conas&#8217; core feature. Hence, the development is concerned with the translation of CAD and BIM models into audio easily understandable by humans. First, it involves establishing access to all relevant data formats for training and testing. Second, putting this information into speech requires the system to understand the semantics of the CAD/BIM model as well as the semantics of documentation and comments given to certain objects. As a third step, the generated text needs to be transformed into speech by a third-party service provider. The front-end realization of Conas includes a smartphone application for construction workers and the cloud to upload models and plans which contain all data that is accessible via the speech assistant. &#13;\\nAcquisition of software service providers and development of APIs: In addition to creating the Conas software, APIs to external service providers need to be set up. Therefore, an essential part of the business model is the acquisition of reliable partners offering their service for the users of Conas. APIs for BIM and CAD software is necessary to read out plans for information such as measures, materials, and locations. Additionally, APIs for services such as language translation, speech-to-text, and text conversion is required.&#13;\\nCustomer acquisition and development of relationships: Entering a broad market with a new product pose challenges for communicating its value proposition to the customer. Therefore, acquiring relevant customers and ensuring their loyalty is decisive for market entry and long-term success. This starts with the development phase by involving construction firms throughout the realization of the product. Marketing and sales efforts are prominent activities, especially during the product launch phase. In the long run, those efforts not only need to be maintained but also improved. &#13;\\n</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>One-time setup fee for translation of construction plan to speech Subscription model depending on the number of accounts Hardware components Individual contracts</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>Conas&#8217; revenues are generated from both one-time setup revenue per project and recurring revenues per customer. To offer the product to a wide range of different construction firms, Conas combines a subscription model with a one-time fee for the first setup. &#13;\\nSetup fee: Construction companies pay an initial setup fee dependent on the complexity and size of the underlying construction project. This fee covers the operational assistance. &#13;\\nSubscription model: Conas&#8217; primary revenue streams are subscription fees to get access to the design-to-speech service via a mobile application. This fee depends on the number of accounts required, which reflects the number of construction workers on-site. The payment system is based on a monthly subscription fee to account for short-term projects. This way, entry barriers are kept low for new customers of different sizes. For example, this pricing model allows for flexibility during seasons of less construction activity.  &#13;\\nHardware component: An additional revenue stream is created by the sale of the hardware component. Earphones equipped with a microphone and noise-canceling feature are bought in bulk and sold to the customer. As the hardware is highly compatible with the software product and features noise cancellation, it improves the performance of Conas significantly in the noisy and vibrating environment on construction sites. Customers are charged once for the component. To attract more customers during the time of market entry, the hardware is also available on a rental basis. &#13;\\nIndividual contracts: In case of high usage volume or long-term projects, contracts are negotiated on an individual basis. This procedure comes along with benefits for the customer including discounts, free hardware, or even a tailored solution. For Conas, these lead customers strengthen Conas&#8217; financial position and possibly provide valuable knowledge for the product&#8217;s further development. </Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Software and API providers Architects and construction firms Project owners and project developers Hardware supplier</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Putting Conas into practice, there are two groups of key partners required. The first group includes partnerships that help to develop the technology and to offer additional hardware. Of similar importance, however, are partners with expert knowledge that share their experience and test the prototype. This second group includes, for example, project developers and architects, that can also create touchpoints with the intended customer segments. &#13;\\nSoftware and API providers:  The service delivered by Conas is supported and complemented by external service providers. These partners are crucial to realizing major and minor features such as reading BIM and CAD data files, translating languages and speech-to-text processing. Using the services provided by these partners allows Conas to focus on its core activities and enter the market more quickly without sacrificing any quality requirements of the product. &#13;\\nArchitects and construction firms: To develop and validate the design-to-speech service, industry knowledge is required. Experienced architects in CAD and BIM modeling and data from existing models can provide valuable insight into early-stage software development. The strong connection to the industry enables Conas to create a product that meets the customer&#8217;s needs and guarantees a high-quality standard. &#13;\\nProject owners and project developers: These partners accompany a construction project from the beginning to the very end. Hence, they not only possess valuable knowledge about the industry but also maintain a network of potential customers. Winning project owners and project developers as partners is a promising distribution channel, not least because of their influence in setting standards on the construction site. &#13;\\nHardware supplier: Conas focuses on a high-quality software product. However, its performance and user experience are strongly dependent on hardware quality. Therefore, the right partner who can deliver the required quality for the production of earphones and microphones is key. A strong partnership with its hardware provider will allow Conas to influence some of the design and functionality decisions of the manufacturer as well as receive favorable prices. This enables Conas to offer superior hardware at a highly competitive price.&#13;\\n</Text></Key-Partners-Text><Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Item>General contractors Subcontractors and specialists Construction workers</Item></Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Customer-Segmentation-Text><Text>The Conas software and hardware solution is a product that serves a B2B market and is primarily designed for employed construction workers as the end users. Customers participate in construction projects with complex plans and execute tasks including measurements, material, and positioning. Conas can support the entire workflow of the whole construction process from excavation to electricity and sanitary works. Hence, the product serves a broad share of the construction market. Conas&#8217; customers can be grouped into three sections: &#13;\\nGeneral contractors: General contractors normally offer all construction works from excavation to the turnkey handover and are targeted for two reasons: first, these firms are concerned with a wide range of construction tasks and can use Conas to assist their workers in performing this variety of tasks. Second, subcontracting is a usual practice in this industry. However, the general contractor is still responsible for the project and is tasked with coordination and process monitoring. Thus, the firms can advise or require their subcontractors to use Conas for faster processes and documentation during construction. This way, Conas realizes multiplier effects. &#13;\\nSubcontractors and specialists: The other customer segment consists of smaller companies which are often more specialized and employ fewer workers. Two implications arise for these companies: first, workers do not execute standard tasks and often require special instructions. Second, if only a few workers of a company work on-site, it brings about greater responsibility for the individual. If supervisors or other co-working partners are not available, the worker can make use of the on-site assistance by Conas to fulfill their tasks flawlessly.&#13;\\nConstruction workers: Construction workers are indirect customers. Their employers pay for the system, but the workers are the people benefiting directly from it. Conas avoids extra work for the construction workers as they don&#8217;t need to search for the supervisors or the paper plan in case of a problem. Instead, Conas supports them in real-time giving them ad-hoc feedback during the whole construction process. &#13;\\n</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Initial Investments Software development CAD / BIM consultation Acquisition of business partners Legal advice Variable Costs Sales and marketing Customer support Fixed Costs R&amp;D Investment IT infrastructure Office space and further work equipment Capital costs</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>To market Conas, three main types of costs arise. While initial investments refer to costs that come along with the development of the product, operational and recurring costs can be split into fixed and variable costs. \\nInitial investments: As with many software products, the initial development of the software requires high upfront investment. To create a viable product, qualified technicians and software developers are required. Further, specialists for CAD and BIM plans consult the technical implementation in how information should be derived from construction plans. The algorithm must be trained to reliably interpret and convert the data into audio information. Furthermore, the acquisition of business partners such as the supplier for earphones is a prerequisite for a hardware offering. Additionally, the use of third-party APIs and software development kits (SDKs) in the software reading out CAD and BIM files, as well as location and translation services, is also a key cost driver. Conas also requires legal advice to clarify possible liabilities. \\nVariable costs: Due to the nature of a B2B market and a large target group, an extensive sales and marketing team including key account management is essential. Marketing experts are tasked to build awareness and create a brand image by developing strategies for the product&#8217;s public presentation, e.g. at construction fairs. For implementation and further customer requests, Conas maintains a call center which incurs further costs. \\nFixed costs: State-of-the-art software products require continuous improvement and technical innovations in. Therefore, a fixed cost segment includes the maintenance of the software product and R&amp;D investments. The main asset of Conas is a high-quality product that enables fast data transfer without interruption. Thus, an appropriate IT infrastructure and user-friendly interface is key to long-term customer satisfaction. In general, a sufficient operational infrastructure includes office space and further work equipment. Lastly, capital costs are not negligible due to high upfront investments. \\n</Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry: In a fully-customized world, construction projects are highly individual which results in time-consuming tasks on-site. A highly fragmented market consists of many small companies. Combining both worlds makes it very likely that companies tend to specialize due to the small number of employees and individual requests from customers. Conas provides the highest value in this scenario due to the following reasons: Individual requests by customers result in many unique tasks for construction workers and almost no standards exist. Hence, audio assistance is extremely valuable for construction workers since every plan is entirely different. On top of that, construction companies are striving to gain market power which requires a larger number of employees. Additional support for workers such as Conas can differentiate a company from its competitors when it comes to recruiting. \\n</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: Exchanging the fragmented market with a consolidated market results in a smaller number of construction companies with a larger size each (up to a monopolist that employs every worker). Hence, the need for companies to differentiate themselves from others decreases. Since customization remains on a high level though, Conas is still a good fit for the market. To increase the attractiveness of Conas in this scenario, coordination of workers could add value for customers. For instance, a conversation with Conas about a measure in a specific room indicates that this worker executed a task in this room. In this way, the construction company can have a better overview of how the workers are allocated on the construction site and which tasks they currently face.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winner builds it all: As opposed to a fully customized world, a fully-standardized world results in very similar construction projects and tasks. Hence, more standards are established and known to construction workers. This decreases the value of Conas to a medium market fit. Nevertheless, this scenario is still a medium fit due to possible adjustments such as the coordination of employees. As standardization increases the usability of automated machines and robots on the construction site, the design-to-speech technology can be adapted to translate digital plans such that machines understand them properly. New building techniques like this can create an advantage over competitors which increases the market share of one player in the market.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: In a fully fragmented and standardized world, companies need to differentiate themselves more than ever from competitors. In comparison to the &#8216;Butler Industry&#8217; scenario, companies tend to specialize less, since more standardization is demanded on the market. Hence, products like Conas can increase the attractiveness of a company on the job market, which is a general goal of all construction companies in this scenario. Just as in the &#8216;Winner builds it all&#8217; scenario, the understanding of plan details like measures and materials can increase the usability of automated machines and robots. Since competition in the construction market is higher in a fragmented scenario, the use of robots can be a critical factor when it comes to gaining market power. Hence, we can increase the value of Conas by additionally offering a translation feature &#8216;design-to-machine&#8217; which is similar to &#8216;design-to-speech.&#8217;\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Craidar</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Enabling Connectivity and Progress Tracking on the Construction Site\\n</H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>In the past 50 years, many industries have seen incredible increases in productivity and efficiency. These industries have especially profited from the automation of processes, enabled through embracing new technologies. Contrarily, the construction industry has not seen much innovation in the recent past. As a result, it is one of the few industries that has not improved its processes significantly. The construction industry shows immense potential for increases in efficiency through the use of new technologies, especially the adaptation of connected IoT-devices. However, most useful applications realizing this potential require a specific form of internet connection, which is in most cases not sufficiently available on construction sites at the moment.&#13;\\nCraidar helps to solve this issue for large and medium-sized construction sites by providing two modules: a Wifi-Module delivering a reliable and fast internet connection to construction sites and a LIDAR-Module enabling the tracking of the construction of the building shell. If a crane is available on the construction site, the Wifi-Module will be mounted on top of the crane. As soon as there is no crane available anymore, the module should be attached to a central and relatively high point on the construction site. Depending on the location and possibilities for providing data in the particular area of the construction site, there are three ways to supply the module: Landline, cellular networks, and satellites. For an optimal connection, especially on large construction sites, the Wifi-Module can be reinforced through amplifiers. These allow the use of IoT-devices, as well as increased automation on construction sites. &#13;\\nThe LIDAR-Module will be installed in the crane boom on the trolley, with which it will move along. After the disassembly of the crane, the LIDAR-sensor provides no additional benefit, since the shell of the building is finished and most changes are now done inside the building. LIDAR-sensors and cameras in the module generate a point-cloud and a 3D-model of the construction site. Craidar will provide an API for manufacturers of BIM- and project-management-software so that the models can be used for automated comparisons of the BIM model with the constructed building shell, as well as automated tracking of the adherence to the planned building process. Also, detection of workers and building material could be improved when utilizing automated crane steering, leveraging the data generated by the sensors.&#13;\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Wifi: Ensuring connectivity on the construction site and large data packages for multiple IoT-devices</Item><Item>Laying the groundwork for an exponential increase of IoT-devices on construction sites</Item><Item>Efficiency gains and cost savings by enabling usage of connectivity-based services</Item><Item>LIDAR: Accurate assessment of building progress</Item><Item>Transparency about the status quo of the building process</Item><Item>Ability to track progress and tailor measures accordingly</Item><Item>3D-Model of the construction site and data of the building process for external use (API)</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Ensuring connectivity on the construction site and large data packages for multiple IoT-devices\\nLaying the groundwork for the exponentially increasing use of IoT-devices: By using the Craidar system, in combination with construction-specific Wifi-amplifiers, it allows for a high throughput of data and enables the proper use of IoT-based machinery. Here, the system serves purely as a hardware component. The Wifi-Module also enables the usage of the LIDAR-Module described below.\\nEfficiency gains and cost savings by enabling usage of connectivity-based services: The use of IoT-devices on the construction site is made possible by the Craidar system, it enhances further effectivity growth, more transparency, time- and therefore cost-savings.\\nAccurate assessment of the building progress \\nTransparency about the status of the building process: By generating point clouds using LIDAR-sensors and cameras at the same time to ensure good cross-sensor calibration, the system generates precise overviews of the construction site and can translate it into a 3D-model of the building.\\nAbility to track progress and tailor measures accordingly: The data generated can be used to assess the building progress. Therefore, project planners keep an overview of the status of the construction site. Measures can be adjusted accordingly, and the project gains flexibility.\\n3D-Model of the construction site and data of the building process for external use (API): The data generated can easily be used by other services using an open application programming interface (API) for data exchange. This enables other software providers (such as BIM and project management tools) to feed the Craidar data into their models. \\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Acquisition (personal assistance/key account manager)</Item><Item>Leveraging partner companies&#8217; customers</Item><Item>Trusted, long-term, personal partnership</Item><Item>Continuous advice, service, and support</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>Acquisition (personal assistance/key account manager): Interviews with construction companies showed that the industry highly depends on key account managers of the large machinery manufacturers when it comes to machine purchases. Offering discounts, warranties and especially high service levels, they manage to sell machines very efficiently. Often, they have a very strong customer relationship. Craidar, therefore, has to aim for an even closer customer relationship than the industry standard. Personal contact, a large field-sales team as well as a strong collaboration between sales, key account management and (spare-part) after-sales are the key elements to reach this goal.\\nTrusted, long-term, personal partnership: The Craidar team should actively aim for an excelling, one-stop service level where any need of a customer can be solved by calling his or her assigned key account manager. To achieve this, service task forces consisting of members of all potentially involved departments have to be set up. The key account managers do not serve as sales agents here, like in other business cases, but more as coordinators of all resources Craidar provides. The sales team should be a separate union which generates leads (inside-sales), pitches the product and closes first-time deals only (field-sales and outside sales). A state-of-the-art CRM and sales tool such as Salesforce will help to achieve this goal, allowing the key account managers to also include live usage-data from the system to monitor customers.\\nContinuous advice, service, and support: By incorporating usage-tracking features into all connected modules, Craidar will be able to detect increased and decreased, and later even right and wrong usage of the system. Leveraging this data, customers can be coached on how to perfectly utilize their system to increase efficiency as well as to prevent breakdowns in the long-run.\\n</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Direct mail and sales Partner network and recommendations (leveraging manufacturers of IoT-devices) Referral program through a network of construction companies Trade fairs and industry summits</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>The construction industry is a highly conservative and fragmented industry, dominated by family businesses. Construction companies can be easily reached through direct (postal) mail to approach cold contacts and inform about our product. Provided these companies have an interest in our product, the sales team can then go into direct contact and start negotiations. Also, as complex hardware sales require a lot of trust on the customer site (reliability, support in case of maintenance problems and more), direct sales are an appropriate B2B channel. Craidar can leverage partnerships with industry associations and build the groundwork for a wide-spanned partner and customer network.\\nWhile construction companies are always competing for projects, there still is a strong network between these firms. Craidar will incentivize satisfied customers to refer products. Possible incentivizes are as aforementioned free data packages, discounts on existing orders or via revenue shares. \\nManufacturers of cranes, construction machines and IoT-devices as well as providers of construction-related software systems comprise the ideal partner network. These companies are perfect candidates to become sales partners. Craidar would provide a revenue share to advertise and recommend the hardware solution.\\nFor tool manufacturers, trade fairs are still very important to network with other companies and to successfully position themselves as a premium brand. Being present at these tool fairs will make construction companies and tool manufacturers pay attention to our product, as well as help with building connections to potential customers and partners. \\nUsing the strong cross-company ties of the industry, Craidar plans to leverage word-of-mouth advertisement by setting up a product referral program, which incentivizes happy customers to either sign new customers or to actively advertise Craidar via their channels. Companies could be incentivized via free data packages, discounts on existing orders or revenue shares.\\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Technical hardware know-how</Item><Item>Patents on the LIDAR-module</Item><Item>Sales network (manufacturers of IoT-devices and crane manufacturers)</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>One of the most crucial resources for Craidar is the technical hardware know-how. The combination and calibration of different sensor types are critical to guarantee a high level of data accuracy. While the hardware itself is not complicated and easy to replicate, Craidar relies on the secure and easy attachment to cranes, as well as software developers to develop the interfaces for communication. Craidar has to tailor the product to work in all use-cases on differently sized construction sites across the globe. It is important to process and prepare the data for further usage. Therefore, technical know-how is key for market success. &#13;\\nThe most important resource of Craidar is intellectual property. While the Wifi-Module cannot be patented, Craidar relies on patents for the LIDAR-Module. Filing patents on the LIDAR-Module allow a competitive advantage and restrict the competition severely in relevant core markets such as Germany. Patents on the LIDAR-Module will ensure long lasting profits from the developed system. &#13;\\nTo sell the Craidar-System, a sales network of manufacturers of IoT-devices, construction machines and cranes is highly important. A partner network containing both IoT-tool-providers with a long history in construction and strong sales networks (e.g. Hilti) is key to promote the Wifi-Module. BIM- and project-management-software-providers can be interesting partners to promote the use of the LIDAR-Module.&#13;\\n</text></Key-Resources-Text><Key-Activities-Canvas><Item>Continuous product development and improvement</Item><Item>Building and maintaining partner network</Item><Item>Training of employees for montage and usage</Item></Key-Activities-Canvas><Key-Activities-Text><Text>Continuous product development and improvement: The LIDAR-Module can be built similar to how it is currently used in the automotive industry. Correct calibration of the Wifi-Module to provide a reliable connection will require a lot of effort, but the technology already exists. Since the technology for both modules is already available, developing the initial system becomes feasible. To beat arising competition, Craidar needs to keep this technological advance and invest a lot of effort into R&amp;D. Craidar also needs to ensure a consistently high product quality to ensure customer satisfaction, making regular bug fixes and updates necessary. Another important part of product development is the maintenance of the API to ensure a functioning interface between the LIDAR-module and the connected devices.\\nBuilding and maintaining partner network: Partners are construction-related manufacturers of IoT-devices, BIM- and project-management-software providers, as well as crane manufacturers who want to offer additional services to their customers. These groups share an interest in a more connected and better-steered construction site, making them the perfect partners for a revenue-share sales partner model. It will be necessary to incentivize crane manufacturers to offer our module with the sale of a crane. In the long run, Craidar will have to negotiate contracts and conditions that enable software companies to use the results of the LIDAR-module and to have a large number of software companies using the results from the LIDAR-Module. \\nTraining of employees for montage and usage: To use the Craidar-System properly, construction companies need to know to properly use the system. After the first purchase, companies will be assigned a dedicated Craidar sales person instructing employees on how and where to mount the system in the form of a workshop of up to 3 days.\\n</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>Non-recurring Revenue</Item><Item>Wifi-device and software</Item><Item>Additional Wifi-modules/amplifiers</Item><Item>LIDAR-device and software</Item><Item>Recurring Revenue</Item><Item>Revenue share for data pay per use/flat rate for data usage from telecommunications providers</Item><Item>Income from customer support</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>Non-recurring Revenue&#13;\\nCraidar&#8217;s major revenue stream is based on hardware sales, with the Wifi-Module as the primary product. Clients can buy and lease the Wifi-Module as the basic unit. For complex building sites, the unit comes with software providing an optimal strategy for setting up the module together with additional amplifiers. The additional amplifiers can be bought or leased. They will be provided through an external partner with Craidar adjusting these for the use on construction sites to ensure an optimal connectivity coverage. The combined forces of the Wifi-Module and advanced amplifying systems ensures a high-quality network.&#13;\\nA second revenue stream will come from selling and leasing the LIDAR-System together with a basic 3D-software, making sense of the data generated so that they can be used by other applications. The LIDAR-System requires the purchase of the WIFI-System. The price of the system depends on the type of crane used and the type of sensors built into the crane. The classical hardware components can be purchased together with cranes to enable more use cases. The earnings are generated by direct sales of the module and will make up most of the revenues generated.&#13;\\nRecurring Revenue&#13;\\nCraidar will also make revenue from the consumed data. In cooperation with existing telecommunication providers, Craidar allows choosing between different offerings of selected data packages or flats suited to the needs of construction sites. Craidar will negotiate the terms and conditions as part of a frame agreement and sell the access to the target group to selected telecommunication providers.&#13;\\nLastly, Craidar derives revenue streams from services around the system. This includes but is not limited to added revenues for special customer services, such as premium 24-hour and on-site support and additional help with the implementation of the system that diverges from the original setup services that come with the purchase. &#13;\\n</Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Suppliers and device manufacturer</Item><Item>Telecommunications providers</Item><Item>Manufacturers of construction machines</Item><Item>Providers of BIM- and project-management-software</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Suppliers and device manufacturers: Craidar will provide clients with a Wifi-Module that supplies the construction site with an internet connection. This unit will be attached to cranes and other elevated points on construction sites. For the Wifi-Module, Craidar will acquire the required antennas, cables, satellite dishes, as well as other hardware components from third-party providers. There is a large number of suppliers available for these components. For the LIDAR-Module, Craidar will produce weather- and a wind-proof case containing all LIDAR-Sensors and cameras. The LIDAR-modules are offered in different types according to the height of the crane and its technical specifications. &#13;\\nTelecommunications providers: For the Wifi-Module to be functional, telco providers are required to provide an internet connection for the construction site. There are three major ways to supply the Wifi-Module with data. For construction sites with an already developed infrastructure, a landline is the optimal solution. For remote construction sites with no landline connection, cellular-networks will be used. If no cellular networks are available, satellite-connection serves as the last option.&#13;\\nManufacturers of construction machines and IoT-devices: Increased availability of IoT-devices for the construction site will raise usefulness and profitability of the Wifi-Module for clients. Since there is currently only a small number of these devices available, Craidar will partner with manufacturers of construction machines to promote machines using IoT-technologies to enable the tracking of usage, predictive maintenance, and other use cases. These partnerships will in return also promote the Craidar-System.&#13;\\nProject management software providers: To fully utilize the LIDAR-Module, Craidar builds on partners who make use of the additional collected data. BIM- and project-management-software-providers are ideal partners, as they can use the collected data to evaluate the process, compare the actual progress to the plan of the project and use the data to display current and expected delays. The data generated by the system is given out to them for free via an API (application programming interface) to incentivize software providers to promote Craidar&#8217;s hardware as a technical enabler for their services.&#13;\\n</Text></Key-Partners-Text><Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Item>Medium and large construction companies</Item><Item>Crane manufacturers</Item></Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Customer-Segmentation-Text><Text>Medium-sized and large construction companies: Construction companies can buy the Craidar-System and install it in their existing cranes or buy it together with cranes from partner companies.

Customers pre-configure their devices targeted to their needs concerning sensor accuracy and size of the construction size. The systems, later on, can be modified according to up- or downgrade wishes. Also, additional components such as Wifi-amplifiers can be purchased with the system. Since the system is better suited for complex building surroundings, large and mid-sized construction companies are the key target group.&#13;\\nCrane manufacturers: Crane manufacturers can be sales partners as well as customer, depending on the intensity of collaboration chosen. By using the patented Craidar-System in their cranes, they can keep the technological edge without having to invest too much in sensor R&amp;D themselves.

Development of the original system is relatively simple since the Craidar-System builds on already existing technology. To stay competitive, Craidar will have to make large investments into R&amp;D for continuous improvement of its system. For processing the data generated by the LIDAR-Module, maintenance of IT-infrastructure will also play an important part. Personnel costs will also be an important part of the fixed costs. Employees are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure, develop hardware and software, as well as marketing, sales, and 24/7 customer support, which will focus on building relationships with construction companies and manufacturers of construction machines.&#13;\\nVariable Costs&#13;\\nThe largest part of the variable costs consists of material costs, such as sensors. Depending on the unit bought, the number of components, as well as the costs for the components varies. Purchasing of material will not be outsourced, because, in order to persist on the market, a high and consistent quality needs to be offered to clients. Manufacturing of the final product will be another part of the variable costs; this will be outsourced to a third party. Telco-providers will have to be paid a revenue share for the data used by customers. &#13;\\n</Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler-Industry: In this scenario, the domination of customized houses within a fragmented market will lead to the need for a high speed of building houses.

At a higher level, such deviations happen due to a lack of knowledge about the design on the contractor&#8217;s side, and at a lower level due to mistakes by the workers. Unskilled workers are prone to make errors in building complicated construction structures, fitting of various appliances such as positioning pipes and wires in a wall, and in installing proprietary equipment from third-party vendors. Often these mistakes are detected too late, due to insufficient monitoring and documentation of what is built. BIM is a highly useful technology that has always had the potential to alleviate many pain points of the construction industry. However, the construction industry has been slow in adopting the technology, and consequently, BIM has not yet been fully utilized as an on-site collaboration tool.\\nWith BIMLENS we make BIM accessible on-site to help workers in executing construction tasks and to allow documentation of design deviations. BIMLENS uses AR (AR) techniques to guide workers in properly installing complex components.\\nBIMLENS comes in two forms: First, a software that can be installed on regular Android and iOS smartphones, and second, as specialized AR goggles. The core feature is centered around guiding the worker to perform a certain task by showing instructions, virtually overlaid on the construction entity. For instance, if a worker is installing water pipes in a wall, BIMLENS will guide her by showing the exact position and orientation of the pipes in the wall. BIMLENS also makes the BIM model available on every worker&#8217;s smartphone. Therefore, in addition to AR, the instructions can be embedded inside the model so that the worker can see the model dynamically changing on her smartphone as per the construction requirement which will allow the worker to get a better idea of fitting a particular component. Since it is not always possible to follow the original design, and some components may be built differently from the design, as a secondary feature, BIMLENS allows documenting these changes inside the model for that specific component.\\n</Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Bridge gap between BIM usage in design process and on-site to increase BIM compliance</Item><Item>Mitigate lack of knowledge of on-site workers caused by worker attrition and subcontracting</Item><Item>Reduce construction flaws that lead to high rework costs if identified late</Item><Item>Update BIM if a task cannot be performed exactly as planned</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>By providing detailed instructions on how to perform tasks to construction workers via a non-obtrusive AR interface, BIMLENS is valuable on four dimensions: BIMLENS increases on-site BIM usage, reduces construction flaws, mitigates workers&#8217; lack of knowledge, and enables workers to document deviations from the model easily.&#13;\\nCurrently, BIM models are used on-site as plotted 2D plans which do not include all the information that can be attached to objects in BIM. Thus, the value of BIM is not realized to its fullest extent on-site. With BIMLENS, workers can directly access the model including all its information. By visualizing BIM details in AR, it is easier to understand, and instructions help to assure that progress is made as intended. As flaws often require expensive rework in later stages of the project, significant cost reductions can be realized and time schedules can be met more easily. Third, on-site workers are often subcontracted, and attrition is high. Thus, knowledge management and education of workers takes time, and no learning curve can be leveraged as workers leave, once they&#8217;ve gained experience. BIMLENS supports workers along the process with specific instructions that help to perform the task. Fourth, workers may sometimes need to intentionally deviate from the model. With BIMLENS, workers can document their work by, e.g. attaching images to the respective objects to enable designers to update the BIM model to necessary deviations. This dramatically increases the value of BIM in late construction stages as well as operations and maintenance.&#13;\\nCustomer Relationships&#13;\\nBIMLENS is not a self-service product since BIM is not standardized and custom integrations with different providers are necessary. Thus, customer relationships are rather long-term and personal. Each customer has one single point of contact, a customer success manager, that offers support and helps with problems. The main goal is to retain customers on the monthly subscription once they signed the initial agreement. Increasing revenues by increasing the adoption of existing customers are more promising that trying to generate revenues from new customers only. In the long run, BIMLENS can also be deployed without the need for personal interaction when BIM APIs are well defined, and appliance makers are onboard. At this stage, self-service customers could be monitored and contacted by the customer success managers when a significant upselling potential is identified, or the customer is otherwise likely to churn.&#13;\\nBIMLENS requires training of on-site and off-site managers at any point in time, as the technology is new and understanding the functionality is crucial for them to lead the adoption on-site. Workshops with them lead by BIMLENS consultants are an essential part of the onboarding of new construction companies. After the first onboarding of existing staff, the customer can decide to either have an expert inhouse who onboard new employees or pay for workshops conducted by BIMLENS consultants also at later stages.&#13;\\n</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Long-term and close relationship to drive change management</Item><Item>Co-creation with early customers</Item><Item>Strong focus on onboarding of new customers</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>BIMLENS is not a self-service product since BIM is not standardized and custom integrations with different providers are necessary.

Especially since customer relationships are long-term and close, sales activities need to be more direct and personal. Trade fairs are an important channel to meet decision makers from the construction industry early on. The fairs allow us to be efficient in the beginning since we can schedule many personal meetings in a short amount of time and get feedback on BIMLENS and establish the first partnerships.&#13;\\nDirect sales are our most important channel in the core customer segment. Most of the interactions will be outbound as creating awareness to drive inbound is expensive in the beginning. Later, PR and print/online advertisements can be leveraged to increase efficiency by generating inbound leads. Events at which decision makers of the construction industry meet will stay an important channel.&#13;\\nSince BIMLENS is implemented by the construction company leading a project and then used by subcontractors collaborating on the project, these subcontractors can make use of BIMLENS without procuring it themselves. Directly selling to subcontractors that lead other projects but have already utilized BIMLENS, is a promising channel as the sales effort to explain the solution is reduced significantly.&#13;\\nSince architects and designers profit from increased BIM compliance and since they are advanced users of BIM, they could act as sales partners of BIMLENS. Using sales partners that already have close customer relationships makes the process more scalable and allows BIMLENS to grow quickly without a large internal sales team.&#13;\\nCustomer Segments&#13;\\nBIMLENS is a B2B solution targeted at medium and large construction companies. The customer segments are uniform and value-driven instead of cost-driven:&#13;\\nThe core customer segment is large construction companies. With increasing BIM penetration, due to regulatory requirements and technological developments, this customer segment looks for smart ways to leverage BIM for their benefit. This segment leads projects and manages many subcontractors on-site. Thus, they benefit the most from the core value proposition of not having to educate the changing workforce by setting up BIMLENS for their projects and providing subcontractors access to it which might also involve hardware. Also, they manage projects of significant size to have the resources to invest in new technologies. The first subsegment within this broad core segment is early adopters. Companies with young management teams will most probably lead to the adoption of AR technology.&#13;\\nApart from the core segment, specialized construction companies who might also act as subcontractors can benefit from BIMLENS as well. As they do not lead projects, they depend on getting access to BIM. Furthermore, it depends on their specialization whether BIMLENS is meaningful to them, e.g. demolition companies probably do not need frequent instructions.&#13;\\n</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Software, IP, patents</Item><Item>Developer platform</Item><Item>Talent</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>The main resource is our software with the research conducted in the field of AR combined with our learnings for the BIMLENS user experience.

Due to the wide range of appliances that constructors have to install, BIMLENS\\' product eliminates the need for installers to have extensive experience by providing them with appropriate on-site guidance for each task they do. Since the market is highly fragmented, the investment possibilities of customers are reduced. This means that BIMLENS will need to focus on working with mainstream products which are already owned by the users and implement a SaaS model. Since the impact of the platform is so high, appliance suppliers will have a high incentive of integrating with the guidance platform and becoming partners.</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: Featuring a construction industry which is very centralized yet offering products tailored to the needs of each, this scenario helps BIMLENS push technology to the limits with a high-tech company owned devices, acquired by the giants of the industry. This availability of capital increases the risk that more tasks on the construction site will be automated, but, as showcased by present day\\'s state of the automotive industry, enough tasks will be sufficiently complex to require human workers. As in the previous scenario, BIMLENS\\'s main product will be on-site guidance due to the diverse array of products constructors have to interact with. Depending on how the construction companies decide to tackle the development of custom software, BIMLENS might face competition from them or have them as partners in co-creating the product. Finally, another impact of the high centralization will be a reduction in the number of BIM software suites in use by the industry, simplifying integration for BIMLENS</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winners Build It All: A world where all the buildings are standardized, and there are very few players in the construction market is one where work is most efficient. Driven by large amounts of available capital and streamlined designs, automation of the construction sites reaches its peak, with robots performing the repetitive tasks. The jobs for which human workers remain cheaper than robots will also be dominated by repetition, but at a higher level, between individual projects. This implies that on-site guidance, BIMLENS\\'s starting product, becomes irrelevant. To compensate, BIMLENS has to shift its focus to documenting executed work and to assisting new workers in learning the tasks they need to do. In this way, the risk can be mitigated, and the company can take advantage of other aspects of the construction landscape, such as ubiquitous high-tech AR devices and the reduced variety of appliances the software has to integrate with.</Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: This scenario is characterized by an industry fragmented to the fullest, but in which each actor does work the same way because of standardization. While automation is not a big risk in this case, due to the lacking spending power of the companies, the reduced complexity of the construction site does represent a threat that BIMLENS has to tackle. Since tasks become repetitive, both at the project and day-to-day level, most of the workers\\' learning on the job is done when they join the workforce and guidance is not required afterward. In this setup, BIMLENS can pivot towards providing the initial training to minimize the onboarding period, and it can further adapt by providing a documenting solution for individual steps of the workers\\' tasks. On the hardware side, the company should concentrate on mass-market devices, which are owned by the constructors. Together with a SaaS business model, this strongly reduces the need for upfront investments and optimally targets the market.</Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Loqui</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Enabling Simple Communication and Task Management on the Construction Site </H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>Often, a sizeable amount of time spent on the construction site is for delegating tasks to construction workers and collecting progress updates. Since these sites could be huge, the time and effort spent in physically meeting a supervisor or worker usually accounts for almost a quarter of the working day. In addition to this, the construction companies face several complaints from residents and office workers situated in the vicinity of the site. To address these problems, we have come up with a solution called Loqui. Loqui is a digital tool for efficient communication between all stakeholders on the construction site, namely the site coordinator, the supervisor, and the construction worker. The application is tackling the alarming statistics of communication being the single most time-consuming item in the coordinators&#8217; daily work schedule and adding to it, existing digital solutions failing to pass the adoption hurdle posed by the construction workers as the end users. On the top layer, the application provides a dashboard, clearly depicting the project structure which is comprised of tasks, their deadlines, and the workers assigned. The coordinating role can create multiple project instances, decompose it into smaller units and assign them to individuals or groups with an associated deadline. The executing role can view all relevant tasks including priority, location, description, associated team members, and due date. Also, the worker can indicate that he is working on a specific task and mark it as &#8216;to-be reviewed&#8217; if it has been completed. The update of workflows is implemented by a simple drag-and-drop functionality, emulating the concept of &#8216;Kanban boards&#8217; which find their origins in the software development industry. This core functionality is supported by automatic notifications for task updates to inform the respective supervisor about the project progress or delay on the one hand but also to notify preceding or succeeding subcontractors about potential delays which they are dependent upon. This helps bridge the communication gap between subcontractors in a highly synchronized workflow setting. The value of this application increases with the size of the project and the number of stakeholders involved and helps to manage this complexity. Another function that soothes the pain of the surrounding residents is the provision of the dashboard via a QR code attached to the construction fence. This dashboard is enriched with information about the current phase of the construction process and estimates of water and electricity downtimes as well as loud noises coming from the construction site. </Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>Process transparency</Item><Item>Trust towards subcontractors</Item><Item>Cost reduction</Item><Item>Reduction of the language barrier</Item><Item>Planning security</Item><Item>Easier work delegation</Item><Item>Reduction of paper work</Item><Item>Public information</Item><Item>Convenience to construction workers</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Often, a lot of site supervisors complain that most of their day is wasted in running around to ensure everything is in order. In order to solve this problem, Loqui is a digital tool to make communication more efficient and effective on the construction site. While researching the feasibility of our tool, we came across other pain-points that could be addressed with the help of our platform. In an effort to enhance the construction process, we aim to develop a tool that addresses these problems. \\n\\nReducing the need for interaction: Supervisors will be able to delegate tasks directly to individuals or groups of workers through the application. Also, workers can view a to-do list of tasks assigned to them with information on where it is to be performed. After completing the task, the worker can update the progress, thereby sending a notification to his supervisor, who can then review the task. Apart from this, the supervisor can also &#8216;request to review&#8217; a certain task. Consequently, there is hardly any need for physical interaction between workers and supervisors. \\n\\nMore reliable communication: Currently, communication is done verbally or on paper, which is subject to damage or getting lost. With Loqui, all communication is in digital form. Therefore, everything is automatically documented and stored for as long as required. The information could be used in other projects or at a later stage in the same project. \\n\\nFaster communication: Construction projects running overtime is very prevalent. By reducing the number of face-to-face interactions between the workers and supervisors, we contract the direct task assignment via mobile devices between the involved parties. Therefore, enabling faster decision-making and reducing idle-time between tasks. \\n\\nIncreasing transparency: Since all tasks are well documented, and to some extent standardized, there will be no discrepancy between what workers are supposed to do and what they think they have to do. Also, the supervisor will tend to give more work to a certain worker if he has always completed his work and updated the progress on time. Also, people working and residing near the construction site can easily scan a QR code on the fence in order to know a basic schedule of the noise, electricity and water downtime. </Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>Intense and direct relationships</Item><Item>Feedback integration</Item><Item>Relational sales process</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>With an already customer-centric approach, it is very important for us to keep the customer satisfied at every step of the construction process. Being new to the market, we want to involve the clients&#8217; opinion even in the development phase to come up with a product that caters to their needs. \\n\\nIntense and direct relationships: We seek to establish an intensive customer liaison and support with active key account management. If the user expresses a difficulty, then he can directly contact his customer success manager, who would either provide him with a solution or set up a meeting to discuss and resolve this issue. This would leave the customer with a sense of comfort as well as safety while using the product. \\n\\nFeedback integration: Another important factor is to gather feedback from customers and include them in the product development process. If the user reports a problem in the functionality or an interface glitch, we plan to reward him with benefits such as a discount on &#8216;x&#8217; number of users per month. This would further incentivize the client to provide feedback and help us create a better product. \\n\\nRelational sales process: Having a SaaS-based model, we will be taking proactive strides to engage the customers with online content, mails, and regular events. A healthy relationship with the customer will make it easier for him to approach us in case of an issue instead of directly switching to another tool or unsubscribing from the service. </Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>Online in-/outbound (targeted advertisement, LinkedIn, contact form on website, newsletter, blog)</Item><Item>Offline in-/outbound (phone calls, billboards, pilot projects/prototyping)</Item><Item>Directly approaching target customers (large construction companies, architects) via exhibitions, uni network, on-site visits</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>To maximize Loqui&#8217;s reach, a well-rounded mix of offline and online channels is utilized with a slightly stronger emphasis on offline measures to conform to currently used communication channels.

In the aspect of distribution channels, we make use of online and offline marketing channels to reach out to our target audience. \\n\\nOnline: Although sales processes in the construction industry are usually done via phone, online marketing channels provide us with the opportunity to target specific groups with our advertising content. Such channels would contain targeted advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook, where you can narrow down your target audience according to personal and professional criteria. Professional networks such as LinkedIn also provide opportunities to reach out to your target audience. In contrast to reaching out to your customers directly, we plan to gain traction by providing proprietary content in the form of newsletters and blog posts.

Since the value increases with each acquired customer, user-based pricing was chosen. The customer can unsubscribe at any point in time for the next month and can sign up again, e.g. when the next construction project starts. Thus, Loqui aims to provide a flexible solution tailored to the specific need of the construction industry to cope with planning uncertainty. The fees vary between small and medium-sized companies, who are paying 29.90&#8364; per month per user with a slight premium over large companies with more than 25 employees who are charged with 24.90&#8364; per month per user. \\n\\nTraining/Customer Support: To increase the adoption of the digital solution and resolve potentially arising issues beforehand, we aim to provide introductory courses for supervisors and construction workers alike. If further issues arise during work on the construction site, we also provide customer support via a helpline.

However, the customer is the construction company itself. As the product pricing varies with the size of the construction project, it makes sense to segment the customer base by size. \\n\\nSmall- and medium-sized construction companies: This segment is, by far, the largest in Germany which makes it attractive from a market size perspective. For smaller companies, the ratio of the amount of time saved per employee to the total money spent is higher. Hence, small and medium-sized companies have to pay a slight premium for the application usage. \\n\\nLarge construction companies: Although there are relatively few companies in this segment, the value of the application increases disproportionately with the size of the construction project. Despite the time savings per employee being smaller than with small and medium-sized companies, the perceived value is significantly higher, which makes this segment the most attractive for Loqui. \\n\\n</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Human resources</Item><Item>IT infrastructure</Item><Item>Marketing and sales</Item><Item>Office</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>Fixed costs: Regardless of Loqui&#8217;s success, there are running costs associated with operating the business. For instance, the company needs to pay for office space, associated supplies, and IT infrastructure required to store the customer&#8217;s data. Furthermore, salaries that are not profit-related can be considered fixed costs as well. Due to the nature of the product being a smartphone app, the fixed costs are comparatively low. \\n\\nVariable costs: Profit-related salaries or ones for outsourced product development fall under this category. Besides that, all spending for marketing purposes is proportional to the output of increased product sales. The provision of customer support services also poses a variable cost position by buying from local service providers. The leasing of smartphone devices to construction workers would also require us to either buy devices for our inventory or share our profits from that revenue source with the partner. </Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry: \\nA fragmented market would entail a greater number of stakeholders involved leading to a higher complexity associated with the construction process. This would create the need for a tool to effectively organize and manage workflows. As a result, Loqui would thrive in such a market. Also, a high degree of customization will amount to more variables involved in the market as well as the construction process. With more uncertainty in the demand and type of building, it would be helpful to have Loqui in order to provide some structure to the process and at least save time and effort spent in task delegation and getting updates. However, this might require us to tailor our tool every time to suit the needs of our customers. Due to an increase in demand in response to both the trends, the &#8216;butler industry&#8217; extreme scenario would be probably the best case for our product. </Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon: \\nThis scenario is essentially what recently happened to the electronics retail industry. Having a fully centralized market, where only a few construction giants exist, would streamline the entire construction process. Each of these companies would have their approach, process, and very likely even their tool for construction management. Since the capital availability of those few companies will be large due to higher margins and synergy effects resulting from the centralization, there will also be an increased role of automation. This does not pair very well with the idea of Loqui and therefore, might be a major hurdle to stay on the market. To still have a stable market share, we would try to partner up with one of the construction giants and focus only on their process. On the other hand, having a customized market might still leave room for Loqui to be used because of the need to coordinate complex tasks that usually have not been done before. </Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winner Builds it All: \\nIn the extreme scenario of full centralization, only one or a few companies would employ all the workforce and oversee all construction projects. Since this aggregation of workforce eases its coordination, the need for our communication solution would decrease compared to today. Full standardization naturally decreases process complexity and reduces the need for visualization and coordination solutions such as ours. However, despite all workforce being aggregated under one leading company, our solution still provides value for prevailing problems such as reducing language barriers, streamlining feedback loops and synchronizing tasks. Although this scenario is among the least favorable, Loqui would still be able to provide value to the construction site, especially with planned functions such as automatic schedule generation or modularized processes. </Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars: \\nIn a fully fragmented market, there is a large need for roles and functions coordinating the many stakeholders in the construction process. Since Loqui aims to solve the problem of complexity arising from the increasing number of stakeholders, this extreme scenario would prove to be highly favorable for our business idea. On the other side, a full grade of standardization in the construction process being coupled with full fragmentation will favor automation, which would, in turn, reduce the need for our solution due to the decreased amount of human labor. However, since our product roadmap contains the modularization of process tasks for reuse purposes, higher standardization would foster the usage of this already useful feature. Overall, Loqui would be a competitive product in this scenario. </Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea><Idea><Title><H1>Modulo - Plug &amp; Play Living\\n</H1></Title><Subtitle><H2>Customizable Modular Apartment Solutions\\n</H2></Subtitle><Intro><Text>The shortage of affordable living space in ever more dense urban areas is one of the most pressing issues in Germany and around the world. The advantages of modular building methods are apparent &#8211; low building costs, short fabrication time, and effective use of the scarce available space. However, modular construction and prefabrication have been mostly applied to the serial construction of, for example, hotel rooms, where customization is not required. As projects like residential buildings require a higher level of individualization, the benefits of this construction approach have not been leveraged efficiently to meet customer demand. \\nModulo resolves this by offering modular, prefabricated apartments which can be customized and ordered online. These modules have standardized outer dimensions and can be &#8220;plugged&#8221; into matching slots of a Modulo frame, a pre-built multi-story structure on-site. \\nTo cover the demand for available slots with the supply of frames, Modulo partners up with project developers who buy frames from Modulo to offer slots in urban areas across the country. On the Modulo website end users can then buy available slots and configure and order according to modules. Each ordering process can be done completely online. In case of questions, customers can request consultation on design and usability by an in-house expert. The customer order is then forwarded to a production partner who prefabricates the module. Upon completion, the module is transported to the construction site and installed into the project developer&#8217;s frame. Modulo thereby connects end users with project developers and with the help of digital technology captures the sweet spot between standardization and customization. </Text></Intro><Value_Proposition_Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Affordable living</Item><Item>Short fabrication and transport time</Item><Item>One-stop shop solution</Item><Item>Customization possibilities</Item><Item>Fixed price and completion date guaranteed</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Customer acquisition</Item><Item>Comparably low initial investment</Item><Item>Reduced risk and organizational overhead</Item></Value_Proposition_Canvas><Value-Proposition-Text><Text>Modulo offers a construction method, which allows for a high degree of prefabrication and standardization and at the same time customization of the interior of the modules. Additionally, Modulo&#8217;s online platform connects end users to available slots in frames built by project developers.\\n\\nThe standardized design and fabrication of the modules allow Modulo to sell affordable apartments to end users directly. Through the online configurator, the process of designing and buying modules is simplified as much as possible. From the size of the bathroom to the painting and floor material, the customer can easily customize his or her module(s) according to personal preferences and needs. To guide the user through this process, best-practice solutions for different sizes, requirements, and preferences are provided. To meet different size requirements, modules can be connected to form an apartment unit. The online configurator serves as the single touchpoint and offers the customer a one-stop shop solution. The system of frames and modules, as well as the comparably high degree of standardization, allow prefabricating the modules. Consequently, the customer benefits from a guaranteed price and completion date.\\nProject Developer\\nFor project developers, Modulo offers attractive investment opportunities with a comparably low initial investment, as well as reduced risks and organizational overhead. The construction method of using a frame and modules, which are plugged in later, allows the investor to provide the initial investment for the frame only. As the modules are directly paid by the end user, the project developer does not need to cover these costs and lowers his investment risk. The high degree of standardization and prefabrication reduces the risk of overrunning time and budget since construction defects, and change requests are minimized and material utilization optimized. This also leads to a lowered organizational effort for the project developer during the building phase. The effort for marketing and sales activities is reduced as well since Modulo supports with sales by putting available slots online and takes an active part in customer acquisition.</Text></Value-Proposition-Text><Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Online and personally assisted selling process</Item><Item>Provision of functional best practice design templates</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Personally-assisted co-creation</Item><Item>Individual consultation</Item></Customer-Relationships-Canvas><Customer-Relationships-Text><Text>End User\\nOnline and personally assisted selling process with a single touchpoint: Modulo offers a very intuitive and easy way to configure apartments even for inexperienced customers. This can be done the very short amount of time without even contacting an architect or an interior designer. Customers can start designing their home by choosing from a list of templates and are guided through the customization process with hints and best practice examples. The configurator detects unfeasible or undesired details and alerts the user by giving suggestions on how to solve the design challenge. At the end of the configuration process, an expert reviews the design and further advises the customer. After the review, the apartment can be ordered and will be directly delivered to the construction site in a very short time, compared to conventional construction projects.\\nProject Developer\\nPersonally-assisted co-creation and individual consultation: Modulo maintains a very close relationship with project developers, who are at the same time key partners and customers of the company. Modulo supports them during the planning phase of their building by assigning a key account manager to each project developer to maximize the service quality and optimize the outcome. After the completion of the construction, Modulo is still in close contact to ensure a smooth process for each ordered module. Moreover, Modulo cooperates with project partners in regards to marketing and sales activities of the available slots through the online platform. Once all slots are filled with modules, the collaboration concerning that specific object is completed. However, Modulo strives to establish long-term relationships with project developers to ensure recurring order and spread its modular construction method and establish a wide network of Modulo frames. This relationship is limited the construction process of the frames since Modulo does not offer maintenance services.</Text></Customer-Relationships-Text><Channels-Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Online &amp; Offline Ads</Item><Item>Websites including Modulo&#8217;s online configurator</Item><Item>Showrooms</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Industry exhibitions and fairs</Item><Item>Direct marketing and sales</Item></Channels-Canvas><Channels-Text><Text>End User\\nOnline and offline ads: End users are mainly targeted and acquired through online and offline advertisement. Ads placed in real estate magazines or websites are expected to attract the most customers, both offline and online. Further offline ads will be placed in topic-related places for example as banners on (Modulo&#8217;s) construction sites. Regarding online ads, Modulo will use search engine advertisement and optimization (SEA and SEO) and retargeting measures to increase its visibility and reach. Since Modulo targets a rather young customer segment, social media is expected to be a valuable channel.\\nShowrooms: In showrooms, potential customers can experience the look and feel of Modulo buildings in real life. Moreover, they can try out the configurator and get information about the entire purchasing process with very little effort. In this way, it is easy to convince customers of the high quality of life Modulo offers as well as the efficiency and the usability of the configurator.\\nWebsite including Modulo&#8217;s online configurator: Once a customer has decided to buy a module, the main interaction will take place through Modulo&#8217;s website and configurator. Through this channel, Modulo&#8217;s key value proposition, i.e., the provision of simple design and supply chain processes, is delivered to the customer. In the event of changes after expert review, further communication and consultation can also take place personally.\\nProject Developer\\nIndustry exhibitions and fairs: On exhibitions and fairs the configurator and a demonstration module can be presented to spread awareness of Modulo and, eventually, convince project developers of realizing their building projects with Modulo. In this way, project developers can be contacted directly, and the functionality and operations of Modulo as a construction method and company as well as its advantages can be pointed out easily. \\nDirect marketing and sales: Modulo&#8217;s salesmen directly address project developers with cold calls and mailings to make the first contact and increase the company&#8217;s recognition.</Text></Channels-Text><Key-Resources-Canvas><Item>Modulo configurator</Item><Item>Data and templates on best practice designs</Item><Item>Design experts and know-how</Item><Item>Patents on standards and solutions</Item></Key-Resources-Canvas><Key-Resources-Text><text>Modulo configurator: Modulo&#8217;s core product is a browser-based application that allows the user to easily configure their living space.

Modulo also provides its user\\'s design advice by offering templates and best practice design solutions. These are developed by experts who adapt them to certain use cases and are iterated automatically while taking configurations and experiences from former customer configurations into account.\\nMaintaining a database of available slots and frames: When Modulo acquires new project developers as customers, it also expands its network of frames. To keep track of this additional living space and to include it in the configurator, databases need to be constantly updated. Customers can then choose their favorite location out of many different possibilities.\\nOrganizing the manufacturing, transportation, and installation of modules: While the transport of the modules is carried out by a partner company, Modulo coordinates the process in order to optimize logistics. Modulo also coordinates the manufacturing process of the modules by synchronizing it with the delivery of the furniture and other facilities. On the construction site, a team of sub-contracted workers installs the modules into the frame.</Text></Key-Activities-Text><Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Item>Margin on module sales</Item><Item>Affiliate margin</Item><Item>Margin on frame sales</Item></Revenue-Streams-Canvas><Revenue-Streams-Text><Text>End User\\nThe margin on module sales: As stated in the cost structure, Modulo does not manufacture the modules itself but has them produced by a cooperating construction company. Modulo charges the customers a margin of 10% on the module sales which is added to the price the construction company charges. However, the module configurator states the total price for the customer. Since Modulo has no impact on the manufacturing costs, the only way to scale its revenue is to increase either the relative margin per module sold, the number of modules sold or the value of individual modules. \\nAffiliate margin: In addition to the margin on module sales, Modulo also earns a margin of 10% on the sale of furniture and add-on services, which are installed into the modules.\\nProject Developer\\nThe margin on frame sales: Project developers hire Modulo to build a frame on their building ground. Modulo commissions a partner construction company to build the frame and charges a margin. This margin currently amounts to 3% of the production costs. The total manufacturing costs depend on the volume of the project, meaning the lot size, height of the building, and total slots as well as the complexity of the project. Therefore, fixed pricing is not feasible. Sales growth can be generated in the same way as for the modules.\\nIn contrast to these, Modulo can choose from several subcontractors that build the frames. In case Modulo can find cheaper subcontractors that are equally reliable, it could lower the manufacturing costs and keep the same absolute margin. In that way, Modulo could boost its revenues as well. </Text></Revenue-Streams-Text><Key-Partners-Canvas><Item>Project Developers</Item><Item>Construction companies</Item><Item>Prefabrication companies manufacturing modules</Item><Item>Logistics companies transporting the modules</Item><Item>Subcontractors installing the modules</Item><Item>Interior and add-on service providers</Item></Key-Partners-Canvas><Key-Partners-Text><Text>Project Developers: Being partners and customers at the same time, project developers hire Modulo to build frames for their real-estate projects and at the same time create additional locations and available slots for Modulo&#8217;s end-users. As available building ground is a prerequisite for Modulo&#8217;s offer, partnering with project developers is crucial.\\nConstruction companies: For the construction of the frames, a construction company is hired. This company builds the standardized frames developed by Modulo. To ensure quality standards and a time-efficient building process a long-term partnership is intended.\\nPrefabrication companies are manufacturing modules: Another strong partnership is established with prefabrication companies. This specialized company allows fast production of high-quality modules. It is important that this supplier is perfectly aligned with the plans and specifications generated by the configurator, as well as the entire production process.\\nLogistics companies transporting the modules: This company forms a key element in the supply chain. It handles the transport of the prefabricated modules from the manufacturer to the construction site. In a future scenario, this company would also execute the relocation of the modules when a customer decides to move to another place.\\nSubcontractors installing the modules: At the arrival of the modules on the construction site, a trained team of workers insert the modules into the frame and connects the wires and pipes of the standardized interface. This simple and standard process allows hiring subcontractors which only need to complete a quick training.\\nInterior and add-on service providers: Other important partners are the suppliers of furniture and add-on services. During the configuration of the building, the customer chooses from their product range. The customer&#8217;s selection is then delivered just-in-time during the manufacturing process of the modules.</Text></Key-Partners-Text><Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Item>End User</Item><Item>Students</Item><Item>Young professionals</Item><Item>Young families</Item><Item>Project Developer</Item><Item>Private project developers</Item><Item>Municipalities (social housing, office spaces, affordable living space)</Item></Customer-Segmentation-Canvas><Customer-Segmentation-Text><Text>For its two-part construction method, Modulo targets a different customer group for each part: the general construction method, in particular frames, are marketed to project developers, whereas the modules are directly sold to end users.\\nEnd-user: The main customer segment of the modules are people looking for affordable living space, including students, young professionals, and young families. These groups have an interest in investing their money on a long-term basis instead of paying rent. Additionally, they prefer to live in cities and accept smaller living spaces. In return, Modulo can offer comparably cheap living solutions which can particularly attract young buyers. However, Modulo&#8217;s building method could also be attractive for other customer segments such as older adults, fast-growing companies, especially start-ups with a need for additional office space, government and municipal entities or any other group that is in need of fast, cheap, and scalable living solutions.\\nProject Developer: To enable the building method, Modulo targets project developers that finance the construction of the frames. These property developers look for rather low investments compared to projects of the same size using conventional building methods. At the same time, Modulo offers a relatively high ROI for the project developer. Besides corporate project developers, government and municipalities are potential customers for frames as well.</Text></Customer-Segmentation-Text><Cost-Structure-Canvas><Item>Fixed Costs</Item><Item>Internal employees</Item><Item>Variable Costs</Item><Item>Payment of suppliers and partners</Item></Cost-Structure-Canvas><Cost-Structure-Text><Text>Fixed Costs\\nInternal employees: The largest item of fixed costs emerge from salaries, in particular, for software engineers, civil engineers, designers, architects, marketers, and salespeople. Software engineers develop and maintain Modulo&#8217;s online configurator. Thereby, they enable one of the key benefits Modulo offers to both of its customer groups, end-users and project developers. Civil engineers, designers, and architects develop and improve the module and frame and make design recommendations. Moreover, they review customized orders before the final commissions and consult clients in cases of problems or questions. To increase awareness and improve the reputation of Modolu&#8217;s building method, marketers and salespeople are particularly important in the beginning. \\nVariable Costs\\nPayment of suppliers and partners: Modulo does not cover any of the construction stages. Incoming orders for frames and modules are only processed and organized by Modulo and forwarded to partners and suppliers that take care of the actual production and construction. Since the costs for manufacturing are borne by the supplier, Modulo&#8217;s production costs are fully variable. They only accrue indirectly through the payments to executing construction companies for modules and frames. The level of variable costs depends mainly on the design of each project. Costs for suppliers and partners that occur along the supply chain are construction costs of the frames and the modules and transportation, furnishing and installation of the modules. </Text></Cost-Structure-Text><Senario-Fit-1><Text>Butler Industry:\\nIn a future where the construction market is fully fragmented, Modulo provides a lot of value for small project developers because it largely increases the customer base accessible to them. Furthermore, the required investments for a Modulo frame are far below classic residential buildings of comparable size, so it is also possible for smaller players in a fragmented market to initiate a Modulo project. However, the modules, even though customizable, will not be able to meet all specialized customer needs. A focus on core customer segments such as students and young families, who have only a limited budget and particularly value the price advantage, is therefore necessary. An advantage of this scenario can be the special status Modulo will likely occupy as it offers the benefits of standardization without neglecting the demand for customization possibilities. Nevertheless, Modulo&#8217;s business model is not a perfect fit for the &#8220;Butler Industry&#8221; scenario.</Text></Senario-Fit-1><Senario-Fit-2><Text>Construct-mazon:\\nThe acquisition of project developers will be tough for Modulo in a world with a fully consolidated construction market. The few big construction companies will likely cover the project development part of the value chain themselves and lack incentives to pay Modulo for tasks they can easily perform on their own. Added to that, the margins on the highly customized buildings the construction companies can offer are probably higher than those on standardized Modulo solutions. On the other hand, it will be easy to incorporate all the projects of the few big players on the platform, which makes it very valuable to customers. The focus for Modulo in this scenario will be the module configurator, which could be sold as a white label solution to project developers and construction companies without setting up a Modulo platform.\\n</Text></Senario-Fit-2><Senario-Fit-3><Text>Winners build it all:\\nThe disadvantages of a consolidated market described in the &#8220;Construct-mazon&#8221; scenario also apply for this scenario &#8211; attracting project developers to the platform will be a challenge. In a fully standardized world, another issue is the likelihood of competing standards for modular apartments, which might make it even harder to find construction companies to finance and build the frames. Again, the focus of Modulo will be the module configurator as a tool offered to the dominant market players, independent of the platform. Because they offer standardized solutions, the configurator has immense value for the major construction companies as they can respond to more individual customer needs while still being able to compete with the prices of fully standardized solutions. That makes selling the configurator a highly feasible business model for Modulo in this scenario. </Text></Senario-Fit-3><Senario-Fit-4><Text>Clone Wars:\\nModulo can cover most of the market in this scenario as it offers standardized solutions but is also attractive for people who still value customization possibilities, which is a competitive edge in the market. Project developers will highly profit from Modulo as a sales channel as they do not have any other chance to differentiate themselves in a world with fully standardized solutions. The low required initial investment and reduced risk come into play as additional advantages that Modulo offers for project developers. In this scenario, the number of possible suppliers for the modules and frames is high, and Modulo, therefore, possesses high market power. This allows Modulo to earn higher margins and to offer lower prices. In summary, the &#8220;Clone Wars&#8221; scenario is a perfect environment for the Modulo, business model.</Text></Senario-Fit-4></Idea></Ideas><Sources-Sections>\\n<H1>Sources</H1>\\n<Text></Text>\\n<Sources>\\n<Source responsible=\"Lucian Riediger\">\\n<H6>1</H6> Agarwal, R., Chandrasekaran, S. and Sridhar, M.
