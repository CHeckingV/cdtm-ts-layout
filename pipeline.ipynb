[1] Hence, the industry first has to catch up with technology trends which are already implemented in other industries before applying latest technologies. Two of those fundamental technology trends that should be adapted are the digitalization of existing processes including data collection and the use of suitable software for communication and collaboration. This general digitalization does not only enable the implementation of more advanced technologies in the future, it is also essential for construction companies right now in order to stay competitive. One example is the requirement for Building Information Modeling (BIM) in public infrastructure projects from 2020 onwards. [2] Additionally, companies can profit from an efficiency increase by digitalizing their processes. [3]\\nOnce processes such as communication, collaboration are data collection are sufficiently digitalized, the industry can focus on more advanced technology trends. Namely, the automation of processes and the use of wearables and exoskeletons. The automation of processes refers to the use of robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and 3D-printers, mainly for the fabrication and building process of construction projects. The use of those devices results in more efficient work, less material costs and most importantly it compensates for scarcity of workforce. [3], [4] , [5] Wearables and exoskeletons approach the problem of scarce workforce from another side. Wearables can further develop the process of data collection as an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to increase safety for workers. [6] Exoskeletons support human workforce by making their day-to-day job physically less demanding and therefore less prone for injuries. Altogether, the attractiveness of construction jobs increases with the use of wearables and exoskeletons.\\nIn a further step, high-tech trends such as the use of the visualization technologies augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be specifically applied in the context of BIM. While VR especially adds value in the planning phase, the use of AR has a large potential during the building process. AR can help construction companies to prevent misunderstandings with both, sub-contractors and customers. This is of large impact since changes at the end of the building process are very expensive and a significant pain point for construction companies. [7] The use of artificial intelligence (AI) requires vast amounts of data of high quality. Therefore, this trend will be relevant in an even later step than visualization technologies. The increase of efficiency in terms of coordination and productivity of tasks is the main application in this field. [8]\\n</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Maximilian Deichmann\">\\n<H2>Construction Automation</H2>\\n<H3>Automation of repetitive tasks enables workers to focus on complex duties.</H3>\\n<Text>\\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), such as drones, robotics and additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing, will offer construction companies opportunities to improve efficiency [9].\\nFirst, in the 1980s UAVs emerged by spraying pesticides on Japanese rice fields. Since then, the technology advanced and is now disrupting industries from filmmaking to infrastructure [10]. In the construction industry, UAVs can help to assess properties on their development potential or to track progress on construction sites. This is done by comparing the data captured by UAVs with the BIM [11].\\nSecond, 3D printing came up in the 1980s as well, when Hideo Kodama published a paper about it in 1981 [12]. Researchers advanced the technology so that there are multiple manufacturing techniques and printing materials available today. Nowadays it is used in multiple industries, for example the aerospace industry to build jet engine parts [13], [14]. 3D printing is highly effective, if specialized small scale products have to be built – such as in the construction industry [13]. In fact, first houses have been built by 3D printers with the help of robots to move the print head, but there are still some technological hurdles to take to reach product maturity [15], [16].\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• A survey among mainly North American companies in the construction industry revealed that 37.8% of them experiment with UAVs, while another 10.2% experiment with additive manufacturing [17].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The global construction market size for business solutions addressable by UAVs amounts to 45 bn USD, which includes flying over a construction site and tracking the progress [10].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• UAVs are already used on construction sites and increasing efficiency [4].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A shell construction single-family house can be built by a 3D printer in 10 hours while three workers would need 6 days leading to cost reductions by up to 30 [18].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• German government increasingly encourages construction companies to use BIM [18].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The current building processes prevent efficiency increases which can be solved with the help of automation [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to physical stress and health security concerns on construction sites, it will become increasingly difficult to attract workers [20].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Advances in high resolution and light weight cameras and sensors, battery lifetime and autopilot navigation enable advancements in UAV technologies [11].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, robotic technologies are increasingly finding applications in the construction industry, because they are learning to operate in unstructured environments [19].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Depending of the application of UAVs, they would film entire construction sites and therefore the workers, which means that privacy issues need to be considered [11].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In order to use additive manufacturing in mass production, researchers still need to improve on different issues, for example the composition of concrete to let it dry faster [15].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Robots are capital intensive and therefore pose a financial challenge for construction companies [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Buildings need to be planned with the purpose to build them automated, which needs to be enforced by management [19].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Robots need to be capable of handling complex and uncontrolled environments on construction sites [19].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The automation of the building processes addresses the problem of finding employees and leads to efficiency increases. Automated construction sites are less dangerous and require skilled workers to work with new technologies, which increases the job attractiveness [21], [5]. Furthermore, there are examples of how automation can improve efficiency. Additive manufacturing for example can save up to 60% in material, 80% in workforce and 70% in time [3]. Furthermore, UAVs are able to reduce costs, increase safety and improve data quality on the construction site [10].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Sebastian Sabbadini\">\\n<H2>Digitalization and Data Collection</H2>\\n<H3>Digitalizing existing processes and data to profit from technological progress</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIt is a generally accepted fact that digitalization has been one of the major driver behind the increase in productivity taking place in most industries in the past decade. Still, it can be observed that there is a large discrepancy between the rise in productivity in the German construction industry, where this measures only 4.1%, and related industries such as manufacturing, which has improved on average by 34.1% over the last 10 years. [3] Therefore, one can draw the conclusion that it is imperative for construction companies to tightly integrate software if they are to reach similar levels of growth. The conversion of standard processes to a software-based approach represents only a first step towards the goal of digitalization, the next one consists in the collection of data through a variety of sensors. The information about many aspects of the development cycle collected in this way may seem to have little worth on its own, but the advent of sophisticated data analysis algorithms opens up a world of possibilities in the fields of monitoring, prediction, optimization and automation.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In the construction industry 93% of players agree that digitalization will affect every process in their value chain. [22]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Less than 6% of German construction companies fully rely on digital planning tools in their process workflow. [3]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In Germany, the call for tenders is already issued electronically for 80% to 90% of public construction projects. [3]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In half of the construction companies in the DACH  region, less than 40% of the employees don’t own a smartphone.

The reason for this is that machine learning, clustering, and image recognition are very flexible methods which provide precise and valuable insights into complex processes. [50] Indeed, they can adapt to their environment and solve tasks that usually require a certain degree of human intelligence. As AI algorithms are increasingly evolving towards mature computational methods, more and more industries are adopting them. Among these industries, several such as manufacturing and transportation are adjacent to the construction industry or at least share similar processes. [51] Following their example, the construction industry will have to adopt these technologies and will, as a consequence, experience considerable relief of its processes with cost and time overruns representing two major shortcomings in daily procedures. [52] By having intelligent software tackling the complexity of construction projects, procedures can be simplified, time schedules optimized, and multiple tasks automated. [51] Nonetheless, the adoption of AI in the near future is expected to happen only at a very slow pace. [53] Yet, increased labor shortage, low productivity [54] and the rising competition from new, by AI-powered market entrants will steer the industry in this new direction. [51]\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In Germany, labor-productivity in construction increased only 4.1% over recent decades, compared to a growth of 11% for the total German economy and 34.1% in the case of German manufacturing.

[56] Hence, the number of software which offers cloud-based solutions increased significantly over the same time. With cloud services, shared data can be accessed from wherever there is internet connection. Therefore, devices no longer have to be in a specific physical location in order to access data. Other advantages that a lot of cloud-based software solutions offer are features such as real-time collaboration or version control. These features allow multiple parties to work on the same file simultaneously.\\nIn 2016, LTE coverage reached 96 % of all households in Germany. [57] This does not only increase mobile availability but also allows fast use of cloud-based software solutions from almost everywhere in Germany. \\nIn the future, one application of remote collaboration which might be particular interesting for the industry is the collaboration in BIM. As BIM is continuously penetrating the market, it is expected that it will gain more relevance in the future especially for the building phase. [2] In that case, a collaboration solution for BIM that allows all relevant stakeholders to work on the same file seamlessly might be of big impact.\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The company Datarella (a provider for blockchain solutions based in Munich) successfully tested an automated blockchain system for arbitration procedures.

Today, buildings serve more than just as a basic need. Construction nowadays also reflects the social and cultural status of a society including values, lifestyles, and desires of individuals. With people adapting to economic, technological, and social changes, building concepts are also constantly being redefined. Identifying emerging behavior patterns contributes to the development of future-oriented buildings and construction methods. In this report, we describe six trends that are expected to impact the construction industry in two aspects: First, they give an outlook on possible future design and properties of buildings relevant to a broad share of society. Second, they cover the way, the work patterns in construction is likely to change. \\n\\nOne of the key changes in consumer behavior is the shift towards customization. Consumers are increasingly demanding individualized products that reflect their personal aesthetic preferences and meet their individual needs. This development challenges the construction industry with a trade-off: While firms can differentiate themselves in offering unique products, this trend affects the efficiency of construction.\\n\\nIn addition, the demands of a highly mobile and fast paced generation have led to the emergence of the service economy. Enabled by digitalization, people strive for time-saving solutions in both living and working environments that offer optional services on-demand. These new consumer patterns challenge companies to offer all-in-one solutions, that enable an easy and flexible lifestyle. \\n\\nSustainability is ubiquitous in almost every aspect of our lives. Pressures to reduce CO2 emissions and a growing public awareness to reduce the ecological footprint foster green building activities. These refer to the design, construction, and operation of buildings, that allow to reduce negative impacts on the natural environment. New energy efficient materials and systems foster this trend.\\n\\nFor urban environments, new concepts to tackle the high influx of people to cities include a reduction of living space per capita. Central aspects of this trend include the shortage of affordable living space, the singularization of households, and the conscious consumer who is less focused on material possessions. These developments require solutions for small scale living. \\n\\nHuman factors are critical performance drivers in the construction industry. In addition to the aforementioned consumer patterns, change can be observed in workforce-mindset as well. Paying close attention to changes in employees’ expectations is crucial. Currently, the share of millennials and generation Z members with different life perspectives and values is growing in society. Consequently, firms are challenged to attract and retain this highly capable cohort of the future workforce. \\n\\nThe German society faces an increased variety in the cultural background of its members. Migration is the key driver of this development. This increased multiculturalism poses challenges concerning integration and language barriers. It is likely that cultural differences will affect the construction industry as a provider of community space and employer.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Simon Höferlin\">\\n<H2>Space as a service</H2>\\n<H3>Concept of flexible, on-demand and serviced living space</H3>\\n<Text>\\nWe are moving towards a generation for which it is natural that ownership is not a prerequisite for using something. Moreover, this generation is used to receive services and goods flexibly, on-demand, and with a simple and fast process tailored to their current needs. Increased mobility in both private and professional life leads to a generation that is less settled down than previous generations. As a result, there is a higher demand for flexible living space. Those characteristics especially apply to the “Sinus Milieus” of the “Performers”, “Adaptive Navigators”, and “Cosmopolitan Avantgarde” [63] which make up to one quarter in society with higher social status and re-orientation regarding their basic values. They desire having multiple options, accelerated lives, and are pragmatic and explorative (Sinus, no date) but also more stressed [64], [65]. Manifestations of this trend are for instance the growth of AirBnB, for flexible rent contracts or the rise of Co-Working spaces [66] like WeWork, offering flexible workplaces plus add-on services and a vibrant community. In a similar way, WeLive is offering “Co-Living” with flexible serviced apartments including a community life, a gym and other perks [67], [68], [69], [70], [71].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The share of 20 to 29-year-old Germans planning to buy a house decreased from 52% in 2010 to 38% in 2017 [72]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The worldwide number of coworking spaces has risen from 160 in 2008 to over 18,600 [66] reflecting the demand for fast and flexible, all-in-one solutions</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 68% agreed to the statement “the business model of real estate investors is changing as a result of the move towards ‘space as a service’” [73]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing post-materialism can be observed which is described as the “shifting from an over-whelming emphasis on material well-being and physical security toward greater emphasis on the quality of life” [ ING77], [74]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Digitalization enables on-demand products and services such as online platforms and configurators [75]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Mobility of people will most likely increase [76] and therefore the need for flexible living space</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Business models shift from ownership to service-oriented models [77]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Customers’ on-demand and high service expectations need to be met by the organization of construction projects</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A requirement will be to offer an all-in-one solution with an attractive design, flexibility and demanded add-on services adapting to the customer’s current needs</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Without a holistic perspective, construction companies might miss important data to optimize what customers want, especially when not being vertically integrated and iterative</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• First, the spotted trend changes what customers desire in design aspects of buildings, such as pre-furnished and serviced apartments as well as common areas to foster community life and pre-installed smart-home gadgets. Second, customers transfer their expectations of mainly digital, on-demand products, being in essence the seamless, flexible, and fast processes, to the construction industry.

As more and more people start to embrace the benefits of metropolitan life, living space is a scarce and expensive resource that needs to be used efficiently [79]. Thus, the reduction of living space per capita frees up capacities to offer housing to more people [80] and to cut energy consumption without sealing ground any further [81]. People are now willing to trade individual living space for proximity to city center, costs, availability, and energy efficiency. This allows for new concepts of living space, including minimalistic, multifunctional, and shared approaches for space usage. They aim to design space more compact, but still generate a high quality of life [82]. In doing so, these concepts account for changes in demographics and family structures. Higher life expectancy and the tendency of young people to delay traditional life choice such as marriage and children creates a need for accommodation tailored to the individual life situation [79]. Therefore, it is likely that the demand for attractive solutions for small scale living will further increase and affect a great share of society [80].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In 77 German cities, around 1.9m affordable apartments are missing, 1.4m apartments among them refer to one person households under 45 square meters [83]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2050, 80% of Germans are expected to live in urban areas [84]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Compared to the previous-year period, investments for student housing and micro apartments rose by 224% to 1.6bn EUR in Germany during the first half of 2018 [85]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The traditional family household loses its market share and matter-of-factness [80]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• There are currently 762 realized and 254 planned community living projects in Germany [86]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Scarcity of building ground, regulations, and rising construction costs shortens affordable living space in urban areas [87]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• A less resource-intense lifestyle and new business models like the sharing economy allow society to reduce personal possessions [88]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Environmental awareness makes society consider the energy consumption and waste production associated with living space [89], [90]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The singularization of households, especially among the elderly, possesses huge potential to reduce living space for an individual [91]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The individualization of society and greater prosperity lead to higher demands for living quality [92]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Elderly people show a reduced residential mobility as they tend not to move into smaller housing, even though their life situation changes and the number of household member decreases [93], [91]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Community and participation in living space can emerge only if the need for individuality and privacy is sufficiently satisfied [82]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Living space needs to be adaptable for different groups of a society and their current phase of life [79]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The shift to smaller living space per capita will change room concepts and hence, the design of buildings. Therefore, due to new requirements, construction may go beyond the mere creation of a building. Firms rather get involved with built-in furniture and flexible elements. To keep costs low, modularization and serial construction should be considered. The reduction of resource usage allows to turn attention to quality and design. Daylight and vertical connections between internal spaces can have an impact on the perception of space [94].

Mass customization and the use of standardized modules have the potential for meeting both objectives [110]. Recent social and cultural developments challenge the housing industry reflecting a divergence between customer expectations and building design. Whereas consumer demands tend to be heterogeneous, physical buildings are still largely homogenous [111]. As a result of the complexities involved in the estimating, production, delivery, and management processes, most homebuyers choose from a limited number of standard products offered by large production builders. Alternatively, they pay a significant price premium for a customized building realized by a smaller custom builder. As customization options drive consumer satisfaction for their industrialized homes, the tradeoff between production efficiency and great customer satisfactions ratings becomes apparent [112]. Successful adaptations of mass customizations in the building industry can be found in the Japanese prefabrication industry, which operates rather like a production industry than a construction industry and combines automation, products and services into their business models [113].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• First initiatives for using smart contracts in the construction industry were launched in the US, e.g. BuildCoin [114]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing use of smart sensors in combination with big data algorithms provides structured data about occurring events and changes.

National companies might be forced to adjust their differentiation strategies to compete with the flexibilities of local contractors. Local contractors might need to adapt production and service innovations introduced by national companies [117]. Modular construction could be introduced as a method of construction which increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the buildings by combining conventional construction techniques with modern mass production models. This could mean that a major portion of the construction work is shifted to high-tech, weather independent factories [118].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Mathis Stolz\">\\n<H2>Green Building</H2>\\n<H3>Sustainable Design and the Application of a Building Lifecycle Perspective</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry accounts for the largest share in the use of natural resources regarding the use of land and extraction of materials. In Europe, buildings account for around 40% of primary energy consumption and therefore significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions [119]. Consequently, a good understanding of the nature and structure of energy use in buildings is crucial for establishing the adequate future energy and climate change policies [120]. Green building applies a whole life cycle perspective during the design process and considers siting, energy efficiency, materials efficiency and water efficiency as key elements [121]. Measures and methods of building green include energy management systems for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) optimization, passive building design and the use of sustainable building materials [122], [123]. Ideally, sustainable building should bring added value for the owners, investors and project developers as well as for the users of the property. This value includes energy savings and related cost reductions over the lifecycle of the building as well as a higher perceived quality of living. But high direct investment costs and a lack of information on energy-efficient solutions at all levels of the value creation chain are obstacles to overcome.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, there are three accepted certificate systems in Germany (DGNB, LEED, BREEAM) with the public DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council) having a market share of over 60% [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Investment in Green Buildings in Germany increased more than tenfold from 600m EUR in 2008 to 7.4bn EUR in 2016 [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2017, there were 830 buildings certified as sustainable in Germany compared to 4,206 in UK and 1,397 in France [123]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• About 50% of certified buildings in Germany are office buildings [124]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2017, the KfW committed over 14bn EUR in funding to energy-efficient construction and renovation [125]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Public awareness regarding the importance of sustainability drives investment in green building projects [123]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Better energy efficiency resulting in cost savings might yield higher financial returns on buildings [126]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Realizable sustainability premiums in rent prices drives profitability of projects [123]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Green building materials, mechanical systems, and furnishings have become more widely available, and their prices have dropped considerably, decreasing direct capital costs [122]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Increased productivity in green office buildings is an important aspect of the overall business case to be made for green building [122], [123], [127]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The incentive for corporates to build green is still mostly based on profitability and marketing effects [128]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Higher direct capital costs of green buildings affordability is a key challenge [129]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Effects of green buildings on prices are difficult to calculate, owing to the heterogeneity of building types and the lack of experience.

While big construction companies and real estate funds might have the financial resources to pioneer green projects, smaller players in the value chain of the construction industry need to invest in developing sustainable solutions. Further, intense collaboration and interdisciplinary project teams are crucial to a successful planning and design process [122]. As the green building trend progresses, it is also important to consider its value depreciating impact on normal buildings. To mitigate this development, building owners should invest in renovations and recycling techniques [122], [126].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Benedict Gruber\">\\n<H2>Migration</H2>\\n<H3>Language and other barriers in the working place</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe effect of language on the integration of migrants is a commonly discussed topic in politics throughout the world.

Existing language training programmes offered by public authorities are available to most affected people. The use of technology can help cover some parts of the language gaps, as is happening right now in the health care and insurance industry [140].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n</Trends>\\n</Trends-Sub-Section>\\n<Trends-Sub-Section title=\"Legal &amp; Political Trends\">\\n<H1>Legal &amp; Political Trends</H1>\\n<Text responsible=\"\">The construction industry has always relied on guidelines, standards, and incentives adjudicated by the government. Laws and ordinances constantly influence the building process, right from planning and construction to demolition and recycling, existing on various levels: EU, federal, state, and communal. The EU issues directives that need to be implemented as laws by European countries within a certain time frame. To foster these laws, the German government may issue additional ordinances that describe the specifications of how a law should be implemented implemented in a specific region, for certain goods or in a specific industry. By identifying governmental policies, regulations and incentives, the following illustrates future trends in owing to political and legal factors, concerning the construction industry. \\n\\nThe past few decades have witnessed an increase in the environmental awareness and international commitments for ensuring a greener future on an individual as well as institutional level. As a result, the German government has ratified several regulations regarding increasing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction industry.\\n \\nAnother environmental trend goes towards more standardized waste management regulations. In Germany, there still exist a multitude of differing ordinances on communal and state level. New laws are planned to harmonize those regulations and will create an up-to-date, for all states unified legal basis.\\n \\nIncreasingly empowered citizens are driving environmentally conscious policies. Through a growing number of referendums, public participation in the decision-making process has been on the rise and citizens have influence on large construction projects. In recent years, a lack of transparency and information to the public has led to the failure of many construction projects.\\n\\nDuring the last decade, a discrepancy between government and municipality spending has led to a large number of underutilized government funds. This has resulted in a delay of many critical infrastructure initiatives, i.e. the expansion of broadband and electricity grids. Now, a strengthened financial situation of German municipalities indicates an increased demand for public construction projects.\\n\\nWith a high demand for construction projects, pressure for innovation is low. This has led to the German construction industry being slower in the adoption of technological advances than most other industries. The current government has often tried to encourage digitalization, especially through the use of BIM. Task forces are being dedicated to the promotion of BIM and governmental regulations are being passed requiring companies to use BIM for infrastructure projects.\\n\\nEven though the construction industry is slow in adapting to digitization, technologies promise faster execution and less risk in planning and safety. However, underlying data privacy regulations are necessary to foster the new innovations. Growing collaboration opens up new questions regarding intellectual property, data privacy and security of data flow.\\n \\nAnother technology that might have an impact on the building process are “Smart Contracts” that change the way contracts are managed. These self-executing protocols will optimize the current process and make it more transparent and reliable. Therefore, politicians and legislators should consider how to cope with the legal impediments and encourage the adoption of intelligent contracting.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Marissa Rimmele\">\\n<H2>Citizen Empowerment</H2>\\n<H3>Rising willingness and opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision-making process</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the past decade, large-scale infrastructure projects have been increasingly present in the public eye. People protesting “Stuttgart 21” and the construction of a third runway at the Munich airport have been highly publicized. Oftentimes, high costs or environmental consequences of a project lead to public outrage, which may result to public referendums. If a referendum is successful, it can paralyze construction projects. Even “Stuttgart 21” was continued, protests led to a delay of almost a year [141]. In Munich, a referendum prevented an additional runway for the airport [142]. In addition, the public influence on city planning is increasing. In 2004, a referendum in Munich decided that no building in the city is allowed to be higher than 100 m. Ten years later, a referendum regarding the development of the abandoned airport Tempelhof declined the construction of residential housing on in the peripheral area [143]. A lack of transparency and information of the public has led to the failure of many projects. With increasing willingness of the public to engage in the decision-making process, the influence of public opinion on construction processes is increasing and needs to be considered during planning and construction [144].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Municipal petitions for a referendum and citizens’ decisions have increased since the 1990s from less than 50 procedures a year to around 300 procedures in 2015 [144]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• From 1995 to 2015 there have been 2,727 referendums in Bavaria, almost 40% of all referendums in Germany [144]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 67% of German Citizens want to participate in the decision-making process [145]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2001, the Aarhus Convention went into effect, providing a right for “access to environmental information” and “public participation in environmental decision-making“ [146]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• For the election in 2018, all parties in the Bavarian Parliament (CSU, CDU, the Green-Party and the Free-Voters-Party) state plan to include citizens in important decisions, with an emphasis on decisions regarding development of cities and residential constructions [147], [148], [149], [150]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Regulations for referendums are becoming increasingly citizen-friendly with less exclusion of topics, lowering the of required signatures and prolonging of deadlines for the collection of signatures [144]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Results of referendums are greatly accepted by the public and enjoy a high legitimacy [144] Willingness of the public to participate in the political decision-making process is increasing [144]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• “Not in my backyard”-mentality: lack of interest for projects as long as citizens are not affected directly, as well as low general acceptance for large scale infrastructure projects [151]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Growing complexity of projects makes it more difficult for citizens to be informed [152]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 29% of referendums are declared as inadmissible, often because of restrictive case law, lack of experience by initiators as well as a high number of required signatures [144]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Participation-paradox: Increasing public interest and engagement with increasing progress in the construction progress with a decreasing possibility for participation [151]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Especially in local projects, the influence of public opinion will grow.

Compared to other EU countries, Germany is far behind, especially, regarding the implementation of BIM [18]. In a study conducted by the Fraunhofer-Institute, almost one fifth of people working in the German construction industry did not know the planning method BIM, with only 14% of respondents working with BIM for more than a year. When planners were questioned about their usage of BIM, only 40% of the respondents said that they use BIM more or less frequently [43].\\nEngland is one of the Europe’s leaders in BIM implementation, having already started a BIM-Strategy in 2007. Since 2016 BIM Level 2 is required for all public projects, as well as for the public tender process [153]. This results in only 16% of construction companies in England having never worked with BIM [154]. Currently, Germany following in the same direction, actively making efforts to foster the standardized usage of BIM. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• In an effort to standardize BIM-usage, the German Ministry for Traffic and Infrastructure (BMVI) published BIM guidelines in 2013 [155]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• On European level a standardization committee is responsible for the standard specifications for the use of BIM, as well as the definition of rules for the handling of the resulting data [154]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Currently, there are several pilot projects using BIM commissioned by public authorities [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The minimization of risk regarding cost overrun and missed deadlines through utilization of BIM is states as a major goal in the coalition agreement between CSU, CDU and SPD (2017-2021) [156]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Gradual scheme by the BMVI: Application of BIM Level I is required for all new projects commissioned by the BMVI starting 2020 [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Stagnation in productivity and efficiency in the construction industry [157]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Slow adoption of the construction industry to digitalization [157]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Increasingly large infrastructure projects require reliable planning methods [157]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Need for early detection of mistakes on construction sites and decrease of risk in the construction process [158]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Little transparency between construction companies and subcontractors [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Slow adoption of innovative technologies by the construction companies [157]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Low technology affinity of the construction industry as well as a lack of training regarding modern technology [157]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• High fragmentation of the German construction industry and the resulting high number of small- and medium-sized construction companies, making investments in BIM difficult [18]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Low number of pilot projects involving small or medium companies increasing difficulty to gain experience with BIM [18]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• With the introduction of BIM into the construction process, projects will become far more cooperative.

With an increasing need for investment in BIM, smaller companies might get a competitive disadvantage and will need to adapt, i.e. through cooperation with bigger companies [158]. Other results of BIM utilization in construction projects might be an increase of productivity and efficiency, as well as reduction of planning risks for infrastructure projects [157].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Joana Haase\">\\n<H2>Standardized Waste Management Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Unified waste disposal regulations at a federal level</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction sector is one of the most resource intensive economic sectors and generates more than 54% of all waste in Germany [159]. The EU Waste Directive of 2008 paved the way for more unified laws and regulations regarding waste management in the EU countries. Every country needs to ensure that waste is disposed in a hierarchical way, depending on the degree of pollution, and that at least 70% of all construction and demolition waste is recycled by 2020 [160]. Despite those regulations, the increasing amount of waste will be a challenge for the future and landfilling capacities are already saturated in Bavaria. Also, there is no standardized ordinance for all German states. To address this, a new ordinance (“Mantelverordnung”) is planned in the near future [161].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act (“Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz”) is being developed since 1994 and was customized to the requirements of the EU Waste Directive [162].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In 2014, Germany generated more than 200 million tons of mineral building waste [163].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Despite the recycling rate of 88% [164], landfills for remaining construction waste are rare and expensive in Bavaria [165].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Since 2005 the German parliament plans a new ordinance for all German states concerning the usage of recycled material and new limit values for waste disposal [161].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The total amount of construction rubble in Germany increased by 13 % since 2010 and is estimated to further increase in the future [166] [167]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to a landfill shortage in Bavaria, more building rubble will be transported to distant landfills leading to rising transportation costs [167]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The prices for locale waste disposal in Bavaria will go up due to landfill shortage  [167]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• As limit value regulations for waste disposal vary from state to state, administrative efforts will be high, if a state cannot dispose its waste locally but needs to deposit it in a different German state</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• If the government implements stricter limit values in the course of new waste management regulations, more waste will be deposited and no longer recycled.

Furthermore, the usage of recycled material will be regulated on a national level [168]. This will lead to less administrative costs. Compared to Bavaria, most German states have stricter limit values for polluted soil. Hence, the “Mantelverordnung” might cause tighter regulations for Bavarian construction companies, when it comes to standardization. Consequently, fewer waste can be recycled and more waste will be disposed. This might entail disposal bottlenecks in Bavaria and higher waste disposal costs for Bavarian construction companies [167].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Shiv Contractor\">\\n<H2>Increasing Energy Efficiency Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Climate change awareness and long-term energy goals are engendering higher energy efficiency</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the recent spate of urbanization, there has been a rapid rise in the per capita energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission, and waste generation. As a result, climate change and global warming have set the stage for governments and international bodies to issue regulations and incentives to implement strategies, adopt practices, and use equipment that help curb these phenomena [169]. \\nThe current political landscape of Germany lies in harmony with most other nations regarding environmental concerns. Over the past couple of decades, Germany has passed several legislations apropos of decreasing energy consumption (on an industry as well as individual level), increasing energy efficiency, and incorporating renewable energies into the power grid [170]. Due to the infrastructural changes pursuant to these regulations, the construction industry is either directly or indirectly involved in these small, medium, and large-scale projects.\\nMoreover, there has been a notable surge in the awareness of environmental issues among the general public, investors, and the industry personnel. This awareness coupled with positive reinforcements in the form of financial incentives are conducive to a major transformation in the construction industry [171].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency (2014) entails raising funds and introducing tax incentives for energy efficiency</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• measures [172]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• With the Energy Efficiency Strategy in Buildings, the Government aims to achieve a virtually climate-neutral stock by 2050 [171]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The Energy Saving Ordinance (2014) includes benefits for electricity generated and consumed internally [173]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• KfW’s ‘Energy-efficient Refurbishment’ program provides financial support for an energy-efficient renovation of buildings [172]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The German building sector accounts for 35% of final energy consumption, causing one-third of the total produced greenhouse</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• gases [171]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• 64% of today’s building stock has been erected without obligation to adhere to any efficiency standards [171]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Approximately 350,000 - 400,000 flats are being built in Germany every year; increasing at a rate of 0.5% per year [174]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Energy balance of a large share of residential and non-residential buildings in Germany is not up to the current standards [171]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Increased awareness regarding energy saving and climate change among individuals, which reflects onto their purchasing behaviour and buying patterns</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Energy labelling of products bolster the market penetration for energy-efficient products [175]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Tenancy laws allow the owner a rent increase option after energy-saving modernization [176]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Energy related renovation of buildings will require permissions from all owners and tenants involved [171]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• New infrastructure needs to be developed to achieve higher energy efficiency, e.g. heat grids [177]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Lack of citizen interest to go through the inconveniences and costs encompassing renovation [178]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• To effectively analyse all pre-existing buildings in order to suggest energy-efficient retrofits Construction companies may find it daunting to build near zero energy buildings while trying to maintain affordable prices</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• With increasing energy efficiency regulations coming into play, governmental incentives and tax exemptions will encourage more people to undergo energy efficiency related renovations Furthermore, an increased transparency in the energy quality and consumption information will lead to a consumer-driven energy market (FED09).

A rise in on-site energy consulting and installation at residential properties as well as SMEs may lead to the inception of a whole new market, creating thousands of jobs (BMW15).</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Denitsa Angelova\">\\n<H2>Decreasing Complexity through Smart Contracts</H2>\\n<H3>Revolutionizing relationships between customers, contractors, and subcontractors</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the age of digitization, intelligent machines gradually are making their way into the construction industry. Following this trend, law practitioners may soon realize new ways of smart contracting. By definition a “Smart Contract” [179] is a piece of software which reflects the logic of a legal contract in a sequence of if-then clauses. It continuously monitors if a certain event has happened and automatically executes predetermined actions; e.g., exchange of services [180], [181]. From a legal standpoint, it may be seen as a subject of mutual declaration of intent between at least two parties [182], where a party could be an organization, a person or machine. Nowadays, the construction industry struggles with a plethora of paperwork and bureaucracy with regard to contract formation and execution. Additionally, it takes inconveniently long time to purchase all needed materials. Smart contracts seem to be a very promising digital tool for reducing overhead costs and optimizing the process how business is done in this industry [183].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• GDPR from May 2018 will require companies to disclose all data related to customers or EU-citizens within a fixed time period.

[182] Since these contracts are fully automated, they may be able to significantly reduce the time for their manual processing as well as transaction fees and costs for intermediaries. Additionally, the scope, type, and size of contract disputes will decrease [185]. Due to the shared transaction history, smart contracts will increase trust through transparency and reliability [180]. This makes them very suitable for implementation of trust agreements and insurance policies [182]. Furthermore, marketplaces for smart contracts for SMEs could be developed in the future which will facilitate the adoption of intelligent contracting [183].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Christian Spier\">\\n<H2>Data Regulations</H2>\\n<H3>Novel technologies and tightening data regulations pushes the industry towards data standardization</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry is perceived as one of the slowest moving industries regarding digitization efforts. However, institutions like the European Union are constantly working on tightening data privacy regulations and enabling data-driven business models, putting a lot of pressure on the construction industry, in particular. For instance, the onset of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25th, 2018 poses a challenge for many small and medium-sized businesses struggle when it comes to storing data digitally. Additionally, the implementation of collaborative and cloud-based technologies such as Building Information Modeling, Internet of Things or Augmented Reality are being tested via pilot projects by major players in the industry. Although such technologies promise faster execution, less planning and safety risks as well as increased collaboration, they also bring up new questions regarding intellectual property, data privacy, and security of data flows. Proposals for free flow of non-personal data have been accepted within the EU, enabling the usage of connected devices in the workplace. Having said that, there are several regulations to be pronounced in order to find the right balance between safety, efficiency, and privacy.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• EU flagship initiative ‘Innovation Union‘ aiming to encounter obstacles like expensive patenting, slow regulatory changes and skills shortages [186] EU proposal for free flow of non-personal data adopted on Sep 13th, 2017 [186b] Onset of the GDPR on May 25th, 2018 [188] Introduction of BIM as a standard requirement for public infrastructure projects setting in 2020 Mostly ‘pen and paper’ documentation, while a single construction project can generate up to two-figure terabyte data [189] New regulations in Germany for autonomous and automated cars from June 21st, 2017 [190] Government incentives for technology transfer [191]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Platform technologies such as the 5G communication standard enable data transmission on construction sites in near real-time Adoption of BIM software across Europe has proven itself as time- and cost-efficient [192] Increasing awareness of data privacy by the end user</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Changing the mindset to store customer information digitally, since data storage is highly manual at the moment Intellectual property issues arise in collaborative project design Fear of increasing competition due to higher transparency No common legal frameworks for innovative technologies Chasm between administrative and operational levels</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Altogether, the adoption of connected devices in the workplace, increasing data privacy regulations and the rise of BIM will urge the German construction industry to accelerate its digitization efforts and by that become competitive when it comes to construction time and costs.

Nevertheless, construction faces an era of significant economic changes which fundamentally influence the development of trending technological or business model developments.\\nThe following section deals with recent economic trends in the German construction sector. We analyzed general macroeconomic indicators on a national level, such as stable interest as well as inflation rates, slightly increasing GDP growth and increasing industry investments driven by domestic demand. Based on that, we then identified six industry specific economic trends which shape the future of construction in Germany.\\nFirstly, we investigated drivers for ongoing growth in the German construction market. Although governmental spending continuously increased over the last years, new residential projects seem to be the driving force behind rising demand. Despite promising drivers like low unemployment rates, population growth or general customer confidence, our findings suggest growth rates in new residential projects to diminish within the following years. As a result, demand in renovation and modernization projects is likely to expand.\\nMoreover, we analyzed the labor market situation in the construction sector, which suffers from a considerable skill shortage. Certainly, the unattractive industry image is a major factor for scarcity in skill. Ageing demographics as well as increasing implementation of sophisticated technological innovations will even aggravate this situation. Continuous training of employees as well as higher salaries will therefore be critical for successful digitization and productivity development within the industry.\\nFurthermore, we researched the operating area, which the construction sector gets more and more international. On the one hand, as demand can hardly be met with current levels of workforce and productivity, German construction companies are collaborating with foreign subcontractors. On the other hand, highly specialized German construction firms are expanding activities beyond country borders. Resulting competition pressure might lower construction prices and increase the importance of international partnerships and networks.\\nAnother strategic response of construction companies on rising demand and productivity pressure is increased merger integration. We identified several tendencies towards local market consolidation through subcontractor integration and movements up the value chain. Increased M&amp;A activities suggest further growth of mid-sized companies and incremental industry margins.\\nThe market landscape, however, will change not only through vertical integration, but also through augmented market entries of innovative players. We found that the digitally underdeveloped sector offers a fertile soil for emerging ConTech start-ups. The number of new entrants as well as availability of suitable digital solutions increase along with the awareness of established companies for innovation importance. Besides forecasted productivity improvements, innovative market entries will result in fiercer market competition.\\nAdding up on that, we finally assessed the impact of expanded digital technology usage on lately stagnating productivity. Comparing the construction sector to other industries, productivity is estimated to increase up to 30%, contributed mainly by digital technologies [2]. An advanced level of digitization and resulting productivity increases in return will attract further investments and boost growth.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kai Siebenrock\">\\n<H2>Deceleration in New Residential Construction</H2>\\n<H3>New residential projects are the key driver but rates are declining</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn recent years, residential construction has been the growth engine for the industry and currently accounts for 61% of all construction investments [193]. The new building business was the major contributor, while renovation projects, which have a higher volume, contributed only marginally to the overall growth [194]. Even in the upcoming years, the residential construction volume is expected to increase due to overall economic strength in Germany, which is accompanied by low unemployment, consumer confidence, and increased disposable income [194]. Urbanization creates a significant housing deficit in urban areas and a need for new residential projects. Population growth due to domestic migration further fuels the demand for housing: the number of private households is expected to increase from 41.3m today to 43.2m in 2035 [195]. German policy makers support the positive development through funding programs like \"Baukindergeld\" and by setting a low interest base rate, thereby evoking attractive financing terms. However, research revealed that the growth dynamics could be slowed down. DIW expects an end of recent years’ boom and considerably declining growth rates [196]. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Housing projects accounted for 61% of all construction investments in Germany in 2015 [193]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Residential construction projects represent the driving force for growth in the construction industry since 2010 due to overall economic strength with an average year over year rate of 12% [196], [193]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Growth dynamic in new construction volume is expected to be reduced from +13% in 2017 to +8% in 2018, down to +4% in 2019 [196]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Number of construction permissions has been stagnant since mid 2016 [196]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In urban areas, purchase prices for housing have grown faster than rent, leading to reduced rate of return for investments [194]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Central banks have initiated an end of the ultra-low interest policies: ECB has announced to end further bond repurchases programs which will lead to a slight increase in interest rates for housing loans [196]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The growth of construction prices has increased more than inflation [195]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• End of boom in residential construction projects leads to reduced growth rates [196], [197]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Demand differs significantly across geographic regions [198]</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Uncertainty in approval rates of construction projects in the future affected by potential new regulations [196]</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The research shows a reduced growth outlook for new residential construction projects in the next five years. Instead, new political objectives in climate protection and energy efficiency restorations are anticipated to strengthen the dynamic in the renovation and modernization section. Companies operating in the residential construction section should prepare and consider engaging in the renovation business. Further, governmental construction projects are also expected to grow due to the improved financial situation of municipalities and the investment backlog of recent years. With this in mind, construction companies should evaluate to expand their business offerings to governmental construction.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kilian Egger\">\\n<H2>Skilled Labor Scarcity</H2>\\n<H3>Upcoming digitalization and demographic change further increase skill shortage</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry is currently suffering a considerable skill shortage [199]. While demand is steadily increasing and productivity is underlying sluggish growth, the number of construction-related apprenticeship graduates has even declined in Germany over the last decade [152]. An overall low unemployment rate of about 3% as well as the industry’s unattractive image to young workers aggravate the struggle for construction employers to close the skill-gap [200], [201]. As a result, sub-contractors are hired. Their unskilled staff and language barriers are partly responsible for delays, bricolage and low productivity in general [201].\\nTwo factors threaten to even intensify this skill shortage within the next years: ageing demographics and the implementation of digital solutions [202], [152], [203]. Firstly, the increasing proportion of elderly people in the population reduces the availability of workforce as more employees retire than young workers are entering the sector. Secondly, upcoming digitization and involving innovation pressure even increase the demand for skilled workers capable of adapting to evolving technologies [204]. Continuous training of staff and higher incentives for potential employees are therefore crucial factors for SMEs to cope with the skill shortage.\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Job vacancies for skilled workers in the German construction sector increased by 91% between 2009 and 2017 and it currently takes on average 160 days to fill a vacancy [199], [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Apprenticeships in European construction sector declined and also adult participation rate in education and training decreased from 9.4% in 2010 to 8.9% in 2016 [152].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Digitalization in the construction industry increases (e.g. governmental initiative “planen-bauen 4.0”) and technological change shifts skill demands predominantly towards high-level skills [204], [205], [206].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• German demand in the construction sector has grown over the last decade with annual revenue increases between 3% and 8% [199].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Working age population in Europe has decreased steadily and is projected to further decrease from 65% to 63% within the next five years [152], [202], [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Number of young skilled workers diminished due to comparably low wages, safety risks and unattractive working conditions [201].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Implementation of digital solutions in construction industry until 2020 raises demand of skilled workforce [202], [206].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasing sophistication of technology demands new and broader skill sets at all levels of construction companies [202], [207].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Continuous training of staff is crucial for sustainable digitalization challenging especially SMEs and sub-contractors with comparably low investment capacity [202].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Construction industry struggles to overcome unattractive industry image and recruit digital talent [208], [207].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The lack of skilled workforce will have profound effects on the development of the construction industry within the next years. Salaries are expected to rise as stable revenues increase industry unattractiveness and low unemployment rates induce better negotiation power for employees [207]. Moreover, skilled labor scarcity decelerates the implementation of digital solutions because investments in new technologies might not seem profitable when critical human capital for digital application is missing. Small companies tend to face higher entry barriers and get forced to focus on certain niches as they might not have enough investment capabilities for crucial implementation of innovative technologies and employee trainings [209].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Till Wiechmann\">\\n<H2>Increased Cross-Border Activities</H2>\\n<H3>Large construction enterprises and highly specialized companies expand to other countries</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIncreasing government spending in Europe and the aforementioned trends of increasing need of residential real estate lead to an overall rising demand. Due to labor scarcity and only modest productivity improvements over the past decades, existing companies in the German construction industry can hardly accommodate the rising demand. As a result, cross-border activities increase in both directions: highly specialized construction companies from Germany expand their activities beyond country borders and foreign “conventional” companies enter the German construction market. The former highly local industry faces both increased labor movement but also an increase in cross-border projects.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Number of international deals in Europe increases [210], [211].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Even though margins in foreign countries are often lower, number of cross-border deals increases for large construction companies [212].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• International growth is mainly driven by largest and specialized companies [213].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Especially companies from EU countries with comparatively slow growth in their home market (Spain, Portugal etc.) begin to build capacities for construction abroad [214].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• After years of budget cuts after the financial crisis in 2008, government spending increase in multiple EU countries.

These new well-connected cross-border competitors are able to offer low prices and challenge existing “local” companies by increasing the price pressure. On the other hand, highly specialized German construction companies are also able to increase their foreign business activities-</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• To engage in cross-border activities, improved logistics are required since most of the small- and medium-sized construction companies operate within a radius of 50km [217]. For this reason, building up partner networks also becomes a crucial part of doing profitable business abroad.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Till Wiechmann\">\\n<H2>Local Market Consolidation</H2>\\n<H3>Increased subcontractor integration and movements up the value chain changes industry landscape</H3>\\n<Text>\\nWhile the German construction industry is still highly fragmented, first movements towards a more consolidated market can be observed [218]. After the market power of large construction companies such as Hochtief or Bilfinger began to diminish, mid-sized companies started to grow their business and are now expanding to take other positions along the value chain. This leads to more integration of subcontractors, which have always been very important to mid-sized companies. Their number and importance for the industry has increased multiple years in a row. Now, this has changed [219], [203], [220], [221]. More subcontractors are acquired by local medium-sized construction firms and are not fully compensated by new market entries, which leads to local consolidation of the market.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Current high demand leads to confidence in the industry. Number of insolvencies went down, but no increase in market entries can be observed [220_2], [223].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• More and more companies begin to integrate subcontractors down the value chain to increase profitability. Other companies also move up the value chain and engage as project planners [212].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Investments in the industry are mainly from Germany, no in- or decrease of foreign investments [219], [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• M&amp;A activity is still comparably low, but slightly increases.

Only way to increase earnings even further is to increase the own margin, e.g. by integrating along the value chain</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Mid-sized construction enterprises try to professionalize and optimize their businesses by controlling bigger parts of the construction process.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Strategic decisions are needed for mid-sized construction companies on what kind of integrations to focus. The options are either trying to strive for full vertical integration in a certain type of construction segment or to move towards a planning company which coordinates others and offers in-house building capacity for certain types of projects</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Payroll overhead risk increases when integrating subcontractors down the value chain.</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• When moving up the value chain organizational capacity building needs to be managed.

Fueled by this development, the complexity of operating a profitable construction business increased with more projects managed end-to-end by one company or by networks of partner companies. This leads to to adverse selection: good subcontractors are increasingly organized in partner networks or integrated in larger companies; “leftover” companies underperform and subcontractor quality decreases. The elimination of management layers as well as reduction of coordination effort allows growing businesses to increase the price pressure, which could force some smaller companies out of parts of the market.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kilian Egger\">\\n<H2>Innovative Market Entries</H2>\\n<H3>Favorable market conditions and innovation potential lure disruptive entrants</H3>\\n<Text>\\nMarket entries and investments in construction tech start-ups grow due to overall favorable economic conditions and digitization potential in the construction industry. Founders and investors have realized that construction lags in productivity compared to other industries and that the digitally underdeveloped sector could benefit substantially from new technologies. Contributing about 10% to the national GDP with increasing revenue forecasts and stable industry development, the European construction sector offers a promising platform for disruptive entrants [220_3].\\n \\nEven though start-ups still struggle with convincing old-established SMEs of their products and services, they are breaking through with mainly collaboration software, offsite construction solutions, project management tools as well as mobile and cloud integrations [226], ETT18]. More mature markets like the United States or Japan act as forerunners with role model companies like off-site constructor Katerra or project management software provider Procore [203], [200], [226]. As it has been the case in other industries, construction is expected to gain significant productivity increases through digital market entrants in Europe. The global manufacturing industry, for example, has seen a productivity rise by 34% on average over the past decade while productivity in ICT has grown by 24% through digital innovation [3], [205].\\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Less than 6% of German construction companies make full use of digital planning tools [227].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Global construction start-up and venture capital activity has been steadily increasing between 2009 and 2018, with 478 closed deals and a funding amount of about 3.73bn € [226].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Networking events like the introduction of the “Tech in Construction” fair in Germany in 2018 evolve and bring start-ups and construction companies together [228].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Market entry and increased number of industry collaborations by start-ups offer project management and documentation software in Germany [229], [217].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Economic stability as well as favorable financial conditions and forecasts for the construction industry are expected [205], [200].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Huge potential to increase productivity by digital solutions within the construction industry should be made use of [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Development of technological possibilities suitable for the construction sector increases [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• R&amp;D expenses as well as innovation partnerships increase within the German construction industry [230], [231].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Construction companies need to open up for collaboration with start-ups and increase R&amp;D expenditures or partnerships to keep on track [227].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Risk of disinvestment in unsuitable or short-living digital solutions [2].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Entrants need to offer standardized and compatible applications due to high interdependencies between multiple stakeholders in the construction industry [152].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Work on construction sites is not ready for implementation of digital solutions (e.g. skill shortage) [152].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Innovative players entering the industry will substantially influence the German construction market. Productivity is generally expected to increase about 10% - 30%. This will allow to meet more of future demand and augment industry revenues [3], [226]. However, higher revenues will increase competition and new technology standards might challenge small construction companies to invest or get forced out of the market.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Lisa Neu\">\\n<H2>Productivity Improvement</H2>\\n<H3>Increased use of digital technologies drives productivity</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the past ten years, productivity in the German construction industry has increased by only 4.1%. In comparison, the productivity development of the entire German economy was 11% during this period [3]. One reason of this modest improvement could be the low utilization of digital technologies. Industries of the manufacturing sector, for instance, take more advantage of the opportunities through digitization than the construction industry and have increased their productivity by 34.1% on average [3].\\nThe use of digital tools and technologies allows the reduction of coordination activities, more efficient scheduling, greater flexibility, saving time and costs [205]. Even though new technologies are more readily available and improvements in the digitalization in the construction sector are expected to lead to higher productivity, construction companies only make little use of them [203]. As technology companies continue to enter the sector, construction firms that choose to be early adopters are likely to gain market share as a result of higher productivity [232], [2].\\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey, in 2016 only 44% of construction leaders reported that their organizations had adopted some type of digital technology; however, there is a visible trend: 70% of the respondents plan to implement digital technologies within the next three years [232]. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Improvements in the digitalization in the construction sector are expected to lead to higher productivity [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Potential global productivity improvement from implementation of best practices is estimated to be 14-15% through the use of digital technologies whereas cost savings are assessed to be 4-6% [232].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• For instance, the use of integrated planning tools on a large-scale oil and gas project achieved a 70% increase in the project’s productivity [232].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Increasingly complex projects and rising demand in terms of volume, cost, and quality require the construction industry to improve its productivity [232].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Many construction projects suffer from overruns in cost and time due to unexpected cost increases, planning errors and insufficiently calculated risks [232].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• BIM will be introduced by 2020 as the new standard for transport infrastructure projects and forces companies to participate in the digitization process [203].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• New technologies are readily available and innovative start-ups push digital solutions into the market [232].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• A minimum of digitization of the companies involved in the project is required [205].

For this reason, and since BIM will be introduced as the standard in 2020 in Germany, a lack of BIM know-how (or other leading technologies) could become a significant competitive disadvantage in the near future [3]. As a result of productivity improvements, construction investments are expected to increase. An advanced level of digitization and productivity will make the construction industry more attractive to investors thanks to cost and time savings, better planning and increasing profitability [205].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n</Trends>\\n</Trends-Sub-Section>\\n<Trends-Sub-Section title=\"Business Model Trends\">\\n<H1>Business Model Trends</H1>\\n<Text responsible=\"Jingchen Wang\">A business model has two basic components: the company’s plans to generate sales revenue and the needed operational factors to reach and maintain profitability. The business models in the construction industry have not changed much in the last few years. The industry has remained resistant to digitalization [9], even as digitalization has revolutionized almost every other industry. As a result of the industry’s conservative nature, the productivity remained low [233]. Today, the industry faces a myriad of changes caused by various social, economic and technological factors. These changes require the industry to reexamine its business models and present an opportunity to adopt digital practices.\\n\\nCurrently, the industry is very fragmented, with small and medium companies choosing to focus on just one stage while bigger companies focusing on multiple stages of the value chain. One way companies can make use of this fragmentation is by evolving their business models to collaborate with one another on different stages of the value chain. Digital technologies enable platforms and project management tools, which could provide means of enhanced communication and cooperation, not just among construction companies but also with customers and suppliers.These solutions could potentially make it easier to cooperate even on large projects and to help increase the efficiency of the whole construction process. \\nCollaboration can be extended to resource as well. To find additional resources for peaks in the production or to boost capacity utilization many new digital platforms are emerging. They try to match the supply and demand to the mutual satisfaction of the involved parties. Flexible resources play a major role in this context and those resources are not limited to hardware. Another factor that affects construction business models is how projects are calculated and planned. In the past, many negotiations for construction projects only had the goal of minimizing costs in the construction phase [234]. However, many decisions made in the initial planning phase have heavily influence the asset’s operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Costs can also be reduced by building more efficiently, in this regard many construction companies try to use prefabricated elements, which were produced off-site in advance. Because of this approach mass customization like in the automotive industry can be implemented in the construction industry too. \\nThese are just some of the most profound trends impacting the business models in the construction industry. All of these trends force small, medium and large companies in the construction industry to rethink and adapt their business models as well as their position in the value chain.</Text>\\n<Trends>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Eileen Einwächter\">\\n<H2>Prefabrication</H2>\\n<H3>Shifting from on-site to off-site construction enables more efficient and scalable processes</H3>\\n<Text>\\nPrefabrication is the practice of producing construction components under factory conditions at off-site locations and manufacturing plants. The components can be either standardized or customized and range from individual components to complete structures. They can be applied to various project types, be it small residential houses or large-scale industrial plants. These structures are then transported to the construction site and eventually assembled to construct buildings [235], [236], [237]. Other terms that have been frequently used to describe prefabrication are preassembly, modularization, system building, and industrialized building [238], [239].\\nConstruction companies around the world have been widely using prefabrication for many years, but current industry trends like the increasing use of BIM and lean construction are renewing the industries view on this practice [238], [237]. US startups like Katerra and FullStack Modular, which use prefabrication and modularization, are on the rise [240]. But also, German companies like Max Bögl are refocusing on modular prefabrication in order to tackle challenges like increasing time pressure under high demand in the industry [241]. The benefits associated with prefabrication include: faster on-site assembly, more controlled production environment independent from weather conditions, reduced waste generation, and safer working conditions [9], [242], [236].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The market share of prefabricated building in Germany has had an average growth of approx. 2.7% per year since 2005 [2], [243], [244], while the market share for prefabricated one- and two-family houses reached 19,3% in 2017 [243].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Off-site construction companies like Katerra and Blu Homes are redefining and reviving prefabrication in the US [240]. In 2017, Alphabet ordered 300 apartment units for around $30 million from FactoryOS, a modular housing startup based in California, in order to provide housing for employees [245].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The Japanese retailer Muji has launched a series of small prefabricated houses called the ‘MUJI Hut’ in 2017 [246].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The increased adoption of emerging technologies like BIM and 3D-printing enable a more efficient use of prefabrication and OSM practices [247], [248].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In the face of housing shortages and the need for fast construction of affordable buildings, the German government has identified modular construction as a possible solution in their coalition agreement and uttered its support [227], [249].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Labor shortages force companies to attract workers by offering more pleasing working conditions off-site [250].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Design flexibility is reduced and limited to possible module configurations and combinations, while users demand individual solutions [9], [251].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• High initial set-up costs as well as increased transportation costs, which depend on the distance from the factory to the construction site, arise [9], [247].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Due to past experiences with prefabricated buildings around the 1960s, poor image and quality misconceptions of prefabricated buildings still remain [9], [247], [252].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The handling of large prefabricated components poses a problem in space-constrained construction sites [9], [250].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Prefabrication not only experiences renewed attention from startups entering the market, but also offers potential benefits for diversified medium-sized businesses [2]. The impact on the business model depends highly on the level of modularization, addressed end-user segments, dependency on additional resources, and individual positioning in the building process [251]. Conceivable business models range from component suppliers to providers of turnkey solutions [251]. As initial investments are high, the transition towards prefabrication is more viable for medium and large-scale companies which possibly already own a manufacturing site [250].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Marc Klingen\">\\n<H2>Whole Life Cycle Perspective</H2>\\n<H3>Plan/build for the whole life cycle instead of only for construction</H3>\\n<Text>\\nLife cycle costing (LCC) describes the process of considering and modeling the present value of all costs along the life cycle of a project, when comparing different alternatives in the design and planning phase [234], [253]. In the past in the construction industry, owners negotiated and contracted construction projects based on minimizing costs solely in the construction phase [234]. However, decisions made in the initial planning phase heavily influence an asset’s operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs and end of life costs [254]. Often, front-loaded inexpensive changes have a significant impact after the construction phase is finished [9], [234]. Thus, LCC is a means to reduce the total costs of an asset by smart and iterative planning.\\r\\nIn other industries, e.g. manufacturing and IT procurement, LCC and total cost of ownership calculations are standard methodologies [255]. In construction, only large asset managers frequently adopt LCC, as they directly benefit from decreased life cycle costs. For projects outside of the portfolio of these asset managers, owners rather focus on minimizing initial costs as they do not plan ahead [234]. LCC is already standardized in some aspects by International Organization for Standardization (ISO), but is not used as iteratively as with BIM [254].\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The present value of O&amp;M and end of life costs of a typical construction project account for 40-80% of the life cycle costs [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• When the use of an construction asset changes, reconfiguration costs are high and heavily impact life cycle costs. Thus, achieving adaptability of an asset is key to reduce life cycle costs [254].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• In Germany, the economics of public projects need to be calculated. However, no iterative LCC is required but the maximum construction costs for the project to be economic are estimated by taking into account the life cycle costs [256].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• BIM adoption increases and sets the basis for collaborative LCC calculations as the cost trade-offs can be modeled transparently and efficiently. This applies especially for projects not owned by asset managers who perform LCC already [257], [18].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Construction companies are increasingly commoditized which drives competition. LCC is a way to differentiate positively from competition [258].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Environmental regulations changed the mindset of owners to a life cycle view already, as environmental aspects need to be considered holistically [259], [212].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Incentives of developer, constructor and asset owner are not aligned as they have different preferences for construction and subsequent life-cycle costs [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Stakeholders of construction and O&amp;M phase rarely collaborate and information is mostly shared paper-based [260], [18]. The building performance is uncommonly assessed along the life cycle and especially in O&amp;M [261].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• LCC calculations are hardly neutral, unbiased and comparable given the impact that different interest rate, inflation rate and life span expectations have. However, these can be easily adjusted [254], [9].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• LCC completely changes the mindset and customer interactions of construction companies. Without LCC, they have very different incentives compared to the owner as they aim to minimize cost and quality within the set specifications. With LCC, construction companies are able to sell quality and good planning and differentiate from competition without engaging in a price war. Especially measures that prolong a project’s life expectancy have a huge impact.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Kai Riemenschneider\">\\n<H2>Value Chain Reconfiguration</H2>\\n<H3>Companies rethink their positioning on the value chain</H3>\\n<Text>\\nIn the coming years one of the crucial questions for individual construction firms as well as the industry as a whole would be which stage of the traditional value chain to cover and which not . The construction industry, especially in Germany, is characterized by a fragmented market, low margins, fierce competition and high pressure on prices [36]. Currently generalized companies covering most of the value chain in various segments exist just as well as specialized ones that focus on one specific segment or step of the value chain. However, several major players like Bilfinger attempt to extend their coverage of the value chain, while decreasing own construction activities [262]. Similar trends can be observed outside Germany; completely vertically integrated construction startup Katerra for example has just recently received almost 1bn $ of funding [263]. As SMEs adopt to these changes, previous separate steps of the value chain are merged, while opportunities for further specialization in specific parts of the value chain arise.\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Due to the complexity of construction projects and extensive subcontracting practices an enormous number of companies is involved in the building process, the €8bn infrastructure project “Stuttgart 21” for example has over 60 companies involved [264].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Subcontractors account on average for over 30% of the costs for a construction project and, like suppliers, have a huge market power [265].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Katerra (startup) and Fluor (incumbent) are examples that outperform other construction companies after successful vertical integration [263], [9].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Major players in the German construction industry like Hochtief and Bilfinger have acquired several companies during the last years which extended their value chain coverage [2].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• An increasing lack of subcontractors forces construction companies to perform tasks on their own [36].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Industry 4.0 concepts as digitization and automation technologies drive vertical integration as the management of complex processes gets easier [266].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Emerging digital platforms assume tasks of traditional construction companies and force them to specialize [267 Business Model Trends: Emerging Digital Platforms].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Varied and sophisticated customer requirements open up opportunities for specialized niche firms [262].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Vertical integration is difficult to implement successfully and costly to reverse in case of failure [268].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Previous competitive advantages (e.g. cost leadership in building) might hamper good performance in other integrated areas (e.g. R&amp;D) [269].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Bureaucratic costs arise in the course of vertical integration, which need to be counted against the possible efficiency gains [270].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• As companies change their coverage of the value chain, no matter integrating or specializing, their current corporate culture will not be as effective anymore [271].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• While highly specialized construction companies had the highest growth rates and highest EBIT in the past years, several industry trends like digitization and resource scarcity will most likely favor especially highly vertically integrated, big and generalized companies [2], [36]. The majority of locally operating SMEs in between those poles, which already lag behind regarding growth and EBIT, might be forced to move in either of these directions to survive in a increasingly competitive environment.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n<Trend responsible=\"Saad Amin\">\\n<H2>Plattforms</H2>\\n<H3>Startups focus on platforms and digital tools for the construction industry.</H3>\\n<Text>\\nThe construction industry has historically consisted primarily of constructors, manufacturers and suppliers.

These digital solutions for the construction industry include not only e-commerce platforms for materials and finished products but also apps and project management tools with a construction focus [240_2]. This segment is where the digitalization is currently taking place.\\nPlatform companies like Alibaba and Amazon are already the world’s most valuable companies by market capitalization [273]. Digital economy will account for 25% of the world\\'s entire economy by 2020 and platform business models represent an ever increasing proportion of this overall total [274]. While platforms present a huge opportunity, the inefficiencies in the construction industry also make space for optimization through digitalization [275].

The trend of an increase in cross company collaboration is a solution to overcome a future where this scattered landscape will stay the same, or even increase. Resulting in the necessity that all of those participants have to collaborate, to form an interplay along the construction value chain and throughout a complete project life cycle [9], [283]. Many of them have to collaborate with each other and become part of shared agreements in order to coordinate the construction of complex projects and products in uncertain and competitive environments [284]. Since the labor resources have been exhausted to the greatest possible extent in Germany, many companies are forced to collaborate with more domestic and foreign subcontractors to find the necessary resources [285], [193].\\nBut even in the face of the ongoing digitization, the construction industry has been very hesitant in implementing the latest software and new processes focusing on collaboration and project management [9]. \\n\\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The amount of subcontractors has risen in the last years [193].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• The business relations between a general contractor and his subcontractors are stable and continuous over long time periods, and only rarely established through competitive bidding [286].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Partnerships and joint ventures are a common practise to share risks in the industry [287].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Because of access to innovation and technology, response to market, resource efficiency and client requirements, contractors are very positive about collaboration for projects [288].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Collaboration with multiple domestic and foreign (sub-) subcontractors is becoming a common practice in the construction industry [193].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• BIM is an easy way of collaborating and sharing information between stakeholders [9].

Unused resources and demand are being matched through the internet to mutual satisfaction of the parties involved. Many examples of business model rise every day around the world from the AirBnB to Uber. This trend is clearly not limited to B2C markets, it also starts to penetrate industrial B2B markets. As for construction industry, it first started in the U.S. with online marketplaces like Getable offering to share contractor\\'s idle equipments with other contractors. This initial idea led, by extension, any type of fleet owner company - whether a contractor, a rental company, or even a manufacturer - the ability to consider sharing underutilized equipment online [290].  \\nThe same goes for labor, where hiring halls are replaced by software platforms (e.g. WORKNOW presented by Colorado Resource Partners), which offer standardised pay at a fair wage, supply workers with skills appropriate to the project and create an automated system for finding instant jobs.\\nRegarding construction materials, companies can benefit from E-commerce in different ways [291]. Various webstores such as XFACTORY and GoFor offer not only a much larger pool of construction materials to harness, but also on-demand delivery service which saves time and money. \\n<H4>Facts:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded a 4.8% rise in material cost over the past year. In an uncertain market, contractors and suppliers alike are concerned about the rising cost of building materials [292], [293].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Unscheduled downtime is a big concern for productivity and is mainly caused due to the breakdown of equipments, which are often very expensive to keep as a backup in standby all time [294].</List-Element>\\n<List-Element>• Successful Sharing Economy business models in B2B markets: \"Supplies and raw materials\" (e.g. GreenTrade.net [295]), \"Hospitality and office space\" (e.g. PivotDesk.com [296]), and \"Equipment, inventory and logistics\" ( e.g. Cohealo.com [296]).</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Key Drivers:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• The risk of unused capital and consequential low rates of return on that equipment [297]. The inverse relationship between the availability of construction jobs and the availability of a skilled workforce [298]. Timely Delivery ensures compliance with flexible schedules.

Higher level of transparency [297].</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Challenges:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• Due to the high cyclicality and volatility of construction business [9], demands of different companies may positively correlate with one another and hence result in short supply. Additional unknowns emerge. e.g.  What will happen to wage and rental rate variability? Will the impact on utilisation of capital truly be improved and by how much? [297] Hard to ensure that equipment is being properly inspected and maintained [290]. Potential high labor turnover makes it difficult for companies to keep the knowledge in-house.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n<H4>Impact on XXX:</H4>\\n<List>\\n<List-Element>• E-commerce and sharing economy greatly increase the availability of construction equipment, labor and material, allow for fleet optimization and provide delivery certainty [290]. Thus they are among the strongest drivers of productivity gains in the construction industry. This will also result in a reduced upfront investment by transforming capital expense to operating expense. Small and medium sized construction companies are supposed to be the largest beneficiary: a greater process-level flexibility is achieved with a much lower initial investment being required.</List-Element>\\n</List>\\n</Text>\\n</Trend>\\n</Trends>\\n</Trends-Sub-Section>\\n</Trends-Sub-Sections>\\n</Trends-Section>\\n<Sources-Sections>\\n<H1>Sources</H1>\\n<Text></Text>\\n<Sources>\\n<Source responsible=\"Lucian Riediger\">\\n<H6>1</H6> Agarwal, R., Chandrasekaran, S. and Sridhar, M.
